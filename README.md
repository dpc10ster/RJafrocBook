### RJafrocBook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dpc10ster/RJafrocBook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dpc10ster/RJafrocBook)



* This book, an extended documentation of the __RJafroc__ package, is undergoing extensive edits. 
* It should not be used by the casual user until I give the go ahead.
* It bypasses the file size limits of __CRAN__, currently 5 MB, which severely limits the extent of the documentation that can be included with the CRAN version of the package.
* I welcome corrections and comments by the not-so-casual-user.
* Please use the GitHub website to raise issues and comments+
