### RJafrocBook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dpc10ster/RJafrocBook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dpc10ster/RJafrocBook)

# What is this repository for? #
* Extended documentation for the CRAN version of the RJafroc package. 
* Eventual goal is to publish this as a book, tentatively titled The RJafroc Book.

# Documentation is available at https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafrocBook/ #
* This book, an extended documentation of the __RJafroc__ package, is undergoing extensive edits. 
* It should not be used by the casual user until I give the go ahead.
* It bypasses the file size limits of __CRAN__, currently 5 MB, which severely limits the extent of the documentation that can be included with the CRAN version of the package.
* Currently the package size is at about 4.6 MB on the CRAN Windows platform.
* I have always wondered why `R` packages have a limited number of vignettes. Now I know why.
* I welcome corrections and comments by the not-so-casual-user.
* Please use the GitHub website to raise issues and comments:
