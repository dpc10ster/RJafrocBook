## To be moved {#froc-vs-wafroc-to-move}

A misconception exists that using the rating of only one NL mark, as in wAFROC, must sacrifice statistical power. In fact, the chosen mark is a special one, namely the highest rated NL mark on a non-diseased case, which carries more information than a randomly chosen NL mark. If the sampling distribution of the z-sample were uniform, then the highest sample is a sufficient statistic, meaning that it carries all the information in the samples. The highest rated z-sampler from a normal distribution is not a sufficient statistic, so there is some loss of information, but not as much as would occur with a randomly picked z-sample.
