## To be moved {#froc-vs-wafroc-to-move}

A misconception exists that using the rating of only one NL mark, as in wAFROC, must sacrifice statistical power. In fact, the chosen mark is a special one, namely the highest rated NL mark on a non-diseased case, which carries more information than a randomly chosen NL mark. If the sampling distribution of the z-sample were uniform, then the highest sample is a sufficient statistic, meaning that it carries all the information in the samples. The highest rated z-sampler from a normal distribution is not a sufficient statistic, so there is some loss of information, but not as much as would occur with a randomly picked z-sample.

## TBA FROC gives incorrect performance ordering {#froc-vs-wafroc-froc-incorrect-ordering}
A basic principle of ROC methodology is that two points on the same operating characteristic represent the same performance.
Presented next are four panels arranged to best show the effect of a change in threshold for RAD-1 and RAD-2. The panels are related to Fig. \@ref(fig:froc-vs-afroc-plot1) and Fig. \@ref(fig:froc-vs-afroc-plot2), but they are arranged differently. The explanation follows after the figure.

TBA Fig. \@ref(fig:froc-vs-afroc-plot4): Plot A is the RAD-1 FROC for two values of $\zeta_1$: the green curve is for $\zeta_1 = -1$ and the red curve, which is mostly buried under the blue curve but the short red extension is visible, is for $\zeta_1 = -\infty$. Plot B is the RAD-1 wAFROC for two values of $\zeta_1$: the green curve is for $\zeta_1 = -1$ and the red curve is for $\zeta_1 = -\infty$. Plot C is the RAD-2 FROC for two values of $\zeta_1$: the green curve is for $\zeta_1 = 2$ and the red curve, which is partially buried under the blue curve but the long red extension is visible, is for $\zeta_1 = -\infty$. Panel D is the RAD-2 wAFROC for two values of $\zeta_1$: the green curve is for $\zeta_1 = 2$ and the red curve is for $\zeta_1 = -\infty$.

In the ROC paradigm, two points on the same underlying ROC curve represent the same intrinsic performance -- all that is happening is that the observers are employing different thresholds that represent different tradeoffs between sensitivity and specificity, see the [@RN1087] study referenced in \@ref(binary-task-model-beam-study). If the FROC curve is to be meaningful, then two curves that differ only in thresholds must also represent identical performance.

In the following the red curve always refers to $\zeta_1 = -\infty$ while the blue curve always refers to $\zeta_1 = -1$.

1.  Plot A: The RAD-1 blue curve is completely buried (i.e., identical curves) under the RAD-1 red curve, except for a short red extension. This is because the two panels correspond to identical values of the RSM parameters $\mu, \lambda, \nu$, the only difference is in the threshold parameter $\zeta_1$: the blue corresponds to $\zeta_1 = -1$ while the red corresponds to $\zeta_1 = -\infty$. If the only difference in the curves is due to the effect of threshold, one has to conclude that the intrinsic performances of the two observers, i.e., 1 with different thresholds, are in fact identical. In fact this is an incorrect conclusion, see below, which argues against the notion that the FROC curve is meaningful.
2.  Plot B: this time the RAD-1 curve extends all the way from (0,0) to (1,1) and so does the RAD-2 curve (most of which is buried under the blue one). A relatively small performance difference is evident: the blue curve has higher wAFROC-AUC = `r wafroc_1_2B`, than the red one, wAFROC-AUC = `r wafroc_1_2E`. The reason for this can be understood by noting that with the chosen $\mu = 1$ threshold $\zeta_1 = -1$ one is starting out on the relatively flat portion of the FROC. Upon extending it to higher NLF by lowering the threshold to $\zeta_1 = -\infty$, the increase in the LLF is modest, but NLF has increased substantially. Since relatively few additional lesions are being localized but the penalty is more NLs, intrinsic performance for the red curve is expected to decrease. The difference in performance is `r (wafroc_1_2B - wafroc_1_2E)`. *The wAFROC gives the correct ordering of the two observers, one that is missed by the FROC.* The argument is more convincing upon comparing the observers' in Fig. \@ref(fig:froc-vs-afroc-plot4) C and D.
3.  Plot C: the RAD-2 FROC curve is partially buried under the RAD-1 curve, a short near vertical segment from (0,0) to (`r nlf_2_2A`, `r llf_2_2A`), in the region near the origin. Thereafter the RAD-2 FROC curve resumes a sweeping arc all the way to (`r nlf_2_2D`, `r llf_2_2D`). Since the two curves are identical except for changing thresholds, one must conclude based on the FROC, that the two performances are identical.
4.  Plot D: the RAD-2 blue curve extends all the way from (0,0) to (1,1) and so does the RAD-2 red curve (a short portion of which, near the origin, is buried under the blue one). A large performance difference is evident: the red curve has higher wAFROC-AUC = `r wafroc_2_2E`, than the blue one, wAFROC-AUC = `r wafroc_2_2B`. The explanation for this is that with the chosen 2 parameters -- $\mu = 2$ and initial threshold $\zeta_1 = 2$ -- one is starting on the relatively steep portion of the FROC and extending it to both higher LLF and higher NLF. Since many additional lesions are being localized, and one is counting only the highest rated NL on each non-diseased case, the penalty of more NLs is more than outweighed by the increased number of lesions localized. The difference in performance is `r (wafroc_2_2E - wafroc_2_2B)`. Again, the wAFROC gives the correct ordering of the two observers, one that is missed by the FROC.

The essential reason why the wAFROC gives the correct ordering but the FROC does not is that the wAFROC, being contained in the unit square, gives the complete picture. The FROC, not so constrained to the unit square, does not. 

Note that the direction of the threshold-change effect depends on the starting point on the FROC: if one starts on the relatively flat portion of the FROC, then lowering the threshold all the way to $-\infty$ decreases performance; if one starts on the relatively steep portion, then lowering the threshold all the way to $-\infty$ increases performance. An intermediate starting point can be found where there is no threshold-change effect.

The argument depends critically on the area under the straight line extension from the end-point to (1,1) being included in the wAFROC-AUC. If this were not allowed one could argue that the end-point of the blue curve (`r fpfRad2B`, `r llf_2_2B`) -- quite visible as the sharp inflection in panel D -- lies on the same wAFROC curve as the end-point of the red curve (`r fpfRad2E`, `r llf_2_2D`) -- not so readily visible. The justification for the straight line extension is deferred to Chapter \@ref(froc-meanings).
