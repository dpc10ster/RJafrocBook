\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the receiver operating characteristic (\textbf{ROC}) paradigm \citep{RN1766} the observer's task is to \textbf{rate} (i.e., assign an ordered label representing the degree of suspicion) each case for confidence in presence of disease. The rating is frequently called a \emph{confidence level}.
\item
  The rating can be an integer or quasi- continuous (e.g., 0 -- 100), or a floating point value, as long as higher numbers represent greater confidence in presence of one or more lesions in the case \footnote{The directionaliy of the rating is not a limitation. If lower values correspond to increased confidence level, it is only necessary to transform the observed rating by subtracting it from a constant value. The constant value can be chosen arbitrarily, typically as the maximum of all observed ratings, thereby ensuring that the transformed value is always non-negative.}.
\item
  For human observer studies a 6-point rating scale is recommended, collected via two questions \citep{RN2680}:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Is the case diseased?

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Binary response: \emph{Yes} or \emph{No}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    What is your confidence in the preceding decisions?

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Three level response: \emph{Low}, \emph{Medium} or \emph{High}.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  With algorithmic readers, e.g., computer aided detection algorithms a floating point rating, if possible, should be retained.
\item
  In the most common study design, termed multiple-reader multiple-case (\textbf{MRMC}), the rating collection procedure is repeated for all cases, treatments and readers.
\end{itemize}

\section{An actual MRMC ROC dataset}\label{an-actual-mrmc-roc-dataset}}

An actual MRMC ROC dataset \citep{RN1993} is included as \texttt{dataset02}. It has the following structure:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{overview-of-the-data-structure}{%
\subsection{Overview of the data structure}\label{overview-of-the-data-structure}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{dataset} structure is a \texttt{list} variable with 8 members \footnote{This is true for ROC, FROC and ROI datasets. LROC datasets have 9 \texttt{list} members.}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ratings of non-diseased cases are stored in the \texttt{NL} list member.
  \item
    Ratings of diseased cases are stored in the \texttt{LL} list member.
  \item
    The \texttt{lesionNum} list member is an array of length 45, filled with ones. It lists the number of lesions per case, which for ROC data, is always unity. The length of this array equals the number of diseased cases \texttt{K2}, see below.
  \item
    The \texttt{lesionID} list member is a \texttt{{[}45\ x\ 1{]}} array, also filled with ones. \footnote{The second ``unnecessary'' dimension is necessary for compatibility with FROC datasets.}
  \item
    The \texttt{LesionWeight} list member is also a \texttt{{[}45\ x\ 1{]}} array filled with ones.
  \item
    The \texttt{dataType} list member equals the string \texttt{"ROC"}, identifying it as an ROC dataset.
  \item
    The \texttt{modalityID} list member is a string array identifying the names of the treatments (see below).
  \item
    The \texttt{readerID} list member is a string array, identifying the names of the readers (see below).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{details-of-the-modalityid-and-readerid-list-members}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Details of the \texttt{modalityID} and \texttt{readerID} list members}{Details of the modalityID and readerID list members}}\label{details-of-the-modalityid-and-readerid-list-members}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The names of the treatments are in the \texttt{modalityID} list member:
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{attributes}\NormalTok{(dataset02}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{modalityID)}
\CommentTok{#> $names}
\CommentTok{#> [1] "0" "1"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For example, the name of the first treatment is \texttt{"0"}. The names can be longer strings, but use of very long string names may mess up the output formats of the analysis report. As per the \textbf{KISS} principle \footnote{For those not familiar, KISS stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid.}, keep the names short.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The names of the readers are in the \texttt{readerID} array:
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{attributes}\NormalTok{(dataset02}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{readerID)}
\CommentTok{#> $names}
\CommentTok{#> [1] "0" "1" "2" "3" "4"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

For example, the name of the second reader is \texttt{"1"}. A similar caveat regarding long reader names applies.

\hypertarget{details-of-the-nl-and-ll-list-members}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Details of the \texttt{NL} and \texttt{LL} list members}{Details of the NL and LL list members}}\label{details-of-the-nl-and-ll-list-members}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For either \texttt{NL} or \texttt{LL} list members, the fourth dimension has unit length. This dimension, which is strictly speaking unnecessary for ROC data, is retained for ease of generalizability to the FROC and ROC paradigms, where more than one rating per case is possible.
\item
  \texttt{dataset02} is a 2-treatment 5-reader dataset (the lengths of the first and second dimensions, respectively, of the \texttt{NL} and \texttt{LL} list members).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{numbers-of-non-diseased-and-diseased-cases}{%
\subsubsection{Numbers of non-diseased and diseased cases}\label{numbers-of-non-diseased-and-diseased-cases}}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{K <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{length}\NormalTok{(dataset02}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{NL[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,,}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{])}

\NormalTok{K1 <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{K }\OperatorTok{-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{K2}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{K1} is the number of non-diseased cases, while \texttt{K2} is the number of diseased cases.
\item
  The third dimension of the \texttt{NL} array is the total number of \textbf{all} cases, i.e., \texttt{K} = 114, and the third dimension of the \texttt{LL} array, i.e., \texttt{K2} = 45, is the total number of diseased cases.
\item
  Subtracting the number of diseased cases from the number of all cases yields the number of non-diseased cases.
\item
  Therefore, in this dataset, there are \textbf{45} diseased cases and \textbf{69} non-diseased cases.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{why-dimension-the-nl-array-for-the-total-number-of-cases}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Why dimension the \texttt{NL} array for the total number of cases?}{Why dimension the NL array for the total number of cases?}}\label{why-dimension-the-nl-array-for-the-total-number-of-cases}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Again, this is for ease of generalizability to the FROC and ROI paradigms.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ratings-on-a-non-diseased-case}{%
\subsubsection{Ratings on a non-diseased case}\label{ratings-on-a-non-diseased-case}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For ROC data a non-diseased case can have only one, and exactly one, \texttt{NL} rating.
\item
  For treatment 1, reader 1 and case 1 (the first non-diseased case), the NL rating is \texttt{"1"}:
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dataset02}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{NL[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}

\CommentTok{#> [1] 1.784058}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This study utilized a 5-point rating scale, 1 thru 5, so non-diseased cases are expected to have low ratings; in this case the lowest rating was observed.
\item
  The mean rating over all non-diseased cases, treatments and readers, is 1.784058.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ratings-on-a-diseased-case}{%
\subsubsection{Ratings on a diseased case}\label{ratings-on-a-diseased-case}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For ROC data a diseased case can have only one, and exactly one, \texttt{LL} rating.
\item
  For treatment 1, reader 1, case 1 (the first diseased case) the LL rating is:
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{dataset02}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{LL[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{]}

\KeywordTok{mean}\NormalTok{(dataset02}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{LL)}
\CommentTok{#> [1] 4.297778}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  As noted previously, this study utilized a 5-point rating scale, 1 thru 5, so diseased cases are expected to have high ratings; in this case the highest rating was observed.
\item
  The mean rating over all diseased cases, treatments and readers, is 4.2977778.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-roc-excel-data-file}{%
\section{The ROC Excel data file}\label{the-roc-excel-data-file}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  An Excel file in JAFROC format containing ROC data corresponding to \texttt{dataset02} is included with the \textbf{RJafroc} package. The first command (below) finds the location of the file and the second command reads it and saves it to a dataset object \texttt{ds}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fileName <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{system.file}\NormalTok{(}
    \StringTok{"extdata"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"includedRocData.xlsx"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{package =} \StringTok{"RJafroc"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{mustWork =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{ds <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{DfReadDataFile}\NormalTok{(fileName)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{DfReadDataFile} is short for \emph{Data File Function to Read a Data File}.
\item
  All data file related functions start with \texttt{Df}, and a similar organization applies to other functions. This makes it easier, in my opinion, to find a function in the \texttt{R} help system.
\item
  To see the online help files, use the following command:
\end{itemize}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{help}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"RJafroc-package"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Click the \texttt{"Show\ in\ new\ window"} button to see it full screen.
\item
  This bit of experiential advice applies, of course, to all help files.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-roc-excel-file-organization}{%
\subsection{The ROC Excel file organization}\label{the-roc-excel-file-organization}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It contains three worksheets, \texttt{Truth}, \texttt{TP} and \texttt{FP}.
\item
  The \texttt{Truth} worksheet defines the ground-truth of each case. It indicates which cases are diseased and which are non-diseased.
\item
  The \texttt{FP} worksheet lists the ratings of non-diseased cases.
\item
  The \texttt{TP} worksheet lists the ratings of diseased cases \footnote{OK, I am being inconsistent. I am using \texttt{NL}, \texttt{LL} for the ratings and \texttt{FP}, \texttt{TP}j for the worksheets. The worksheet format will accept \texttt{NL} and \texttt{LL} instead of \texttt{FP} and \texttt{TP}. However, for ease of generalization to the FROC pardigm it is necessary to use \texttt{NL} and \texttt{LL} for the list members of the dataset object.}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-truth-worksheet-organization}{%
\subsubsection{The Truth worksheet organization}\label{the-truth-worksheet-organization}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{CaseID} column lists the numeric labels identifying each case. Again, string names are possible, but keep them short.
\item
  A \texttt{1} in the \texttt{LesionID} column denotes a diseased case.
\item
  A \texttt{0} in the \texttt{LesionID} column denotes a non-diseased case.
\item
  The \texttt{Weight} column is irrelevant for ROC data \footnote{It is only needed for FROC data.}.
\item
  The contents of the \texttt{Truth} worksheet corresponding to \texttt{dataset02} are displayed next:
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/ROC-Truth-1.png}\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/ROC-Truth-2.png}\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/ROC-Truth-3.png}\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/ROC-Truth-4.png}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are 69 non-diseased cases (labeled 1-69) under column \texttt{CaseID}.
\item
  There are 45 diseased cases (labeled 70-114) under column \texttt{CaseID}.\\
\item
  The \texttt{LesionID} field for each non-diseased case (e.g., \texttt{CaseID} = 1) is zero. A zero in this field defines a non-diseased case.
\item
  The \texttt{LesionID} field for each diseased case (e.g., \texttt{CaseID} = 70) is unity. A unit value in this field defines a diseased case.
\item
  The \texttt{Weights} field is irrelevant for ROC datasets. For convenience it is filled with zeroes.

\item
  The \texttt{FP} (or \texttt{NL}) worksheet lists the ratings of non-diseased cases.

  The \textbf{ModalityID} values range from \texttt{0} to \texttt{1}, corresponding to two treatments.
\item
  The \textbf{ReaderID} values range from \texttt{0} to \texttt{4}, corresponding to five readers.
\item
  The \textbf{CaseID} values range from \texttt{1} to \texttt{69}, corresponding to non-diseased cases \textbf{only}.
\item
  For each reader and treatment, each non-diseased case gets one rating; therefore the length of the column labeled \textbf{FP-Rating} is \textbf{69 x 2 x 5 = 690}.
\item
  The FP ratings tend to be low, there are a lot of ones, fewer twos, even fewer threes, and an ocassional four and a five rating may be found.

* For each reader and treatment, each non-diseased case gets one rating; therefore the length of the column labeled \textbf{FP-Rating} is \textbf{45 x 2 x 5 = 450}.
* The TP ratings tend to be high, there are a lot of fives, fewer fours, even fewer threes, and an ocassional two and a one rating may be found.

\item
  Since each case gets one rating, the ROC data structure is relatively easy to visualize. All of the information in the three Excel worksheets can be summarize by a two-row five column table (with 10 values), with one row listing the number of non-diseased cases rated 1, the number rated two, etc., upto the number rated five, and a corresponding row for diseased cases. These 10 values contain all of the information contained in the Excel file.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In the free-response ROC (\textbf{FROC}) paradigm \citep{RN85} the observer's task is to indicate (i.e., \textbf{mark} the location of) and \textbf{rate} (i.e., assign an ordered label - or confidence level - representing the degree of suspicion) regions in the image that are perceived as suspicious for presence of disease. Accordingly, FROC data consists of \textbf{mark-rating pairs}, where each mark indicates a region \footnote{In order to avoid confusion with the ROI-paradigm, I do not like to use the term ROI to describe the marks made by the observer.} that was considered suspicious for presence of a localized lesion and the rating is the corresponding confidence level. The number of mark-rating pairs on any particular case is a-priori unpredictable. It is a non-negative random integer (i.e., 0, 1, 2, \ldots{}) that depends on the case, the reader and the modality. The relatively unstructured nature of FROC data makes FROC paradigm data more difficult to analyze than ROC paradigm data \footnote{Recall that the ROC paradigm always yields a single rating per case.}.
\item
  By adopting a proximity criterion, each mark is classified by the investigator as a lesion localization (LL) - if it is close to a real lesion - or a non-lesion localization (NL) otherwise.
\item
  The rating can be an integer or quasi- continuous (e.g., 0 -- 100), or a floating point value, as long as higher numbers represent greater confidence in presence of one or more lesions in the ROI \footnote{The directionaliy of the rating is not a limitation. If lower values correspond to increased confidence level, it is only necessary to transform the observed rating by subtracting it from a constant value. The constant value can be chosen arbitrarily, typically as the maximum of all observed ratings, thereby ensuring that the transformed value is always non-negative.}.
\item
  Region-level-normal ratings are stored in the \texttt{NL} field and region-level-abnormal ratings are stored in the \texttt{LL} field.
\end{itemize}

An actual FROC dataset \citep{RN1882} is included as \texttt{dataset04}, which has the following \texttt{dataset} structure:

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Examination of the output reveals that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{dataset} structure is a list with 8 members.
\item
  This is a 5-treatment 4-reader dataset (the lengths of the first and second dimensions, respectively, of the \texttt{NL} and \texttt{LL} arrays). The names of the treatments are in the \texttt{modalityID} array:

\end{Shaded}

For example, the name of the second reader is \texttt{"3"}. Apparently reader \texttt{"2"} ``dropped out'' of the study.

  The third dimension of the \texttt{NL} array is the total number of \textbf{all} cases, i.e., 200, and the third dimension of the \texttt{LL} array, i.e., 100, is the total number of diseased cases.
\item
  Subtracting the number of diseased cases from the number of all cases yields the number of non-diseased cases.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Obviously, a real rating cannot be negative infinity \footnote{If an observer is so highly confident in the \emph{absence} of a localized lesion, he will simply \emph{not mark} the location in question; if he did, then, logically, he should mark \emph{all} areas in the image that are definitely not lesions; in the FROC paradigm only regions with a reasonable degree of suspicion are marked. The radiologist only wishes to draw attention to regions that are reasonably suspicious; the definition of ``reasonable'' is determined by clinical considerations.}. This value is reserved for \textbf{missing ratings}, and more generally, \textbf{missing marks} \footnote{Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between marks and ratings.}. For example, since all values in the above code chunk are negative infinities, this means this treatment-reader-case combination did not yield any mark-rating pairs. This possibility, alluded to above, is only possible with FROC data. All other paradigms (ROC, LROC and ROI) yield at least one rating per case.
\item
  The length of the fourth dimension of the \texttt{NL} array is determined by that treatment-reader-case combination yielding the maximum number of \texttt{NLs}. Consider the following chunk:

\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This shows that the fourth dimension of the \texttt{NL} array has to be of length 7 because \emph{one, and only reader}, specifically reader ``4'', made 7 \texttt{NL} marks on a diseased case in treatment ``5''!

An Excel file in JAFROC format containing simulated ROI data corresponding to \texttt{dataset04}, is included with the distribution. The first command (below) finds the location of the file and the second command reads it and saves it to a dataset object \texttt{ds}.

The \texttt{DfReadDataFile} function automatically recognizes that this is an \emph{ROI} dataset. Its structure is similar to the JAFROC format Excel file, with some important differences, noted below. It contains three worksheets:

\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/FROC-TP-Truth-1.png}\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth,height=\textheight]{images/FROC-TP-Truth-2.png}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{Truth} worksheet - this indicates which cases are diseased and which are non-diseased and the number of ROI-level-abnormal region on each case.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    There are 50 normal cases (labeled 1-50) under column \texttt{CaseID} and 40 abnormal cases (labeled 51-90).\\
  \item
    The \texttt{LesionID} field for each normal case (e.g., \texttt{CaseID} = 1) is zero and there is one row per case. For abnormal cases, this field has a variable number of entries, ranging from 1 to 4. As an example, there are two rows for \texttt{CaseID} = 51 in the Excel file: one with \texttt{LesionID} = 2 and one with \texttt{LesionID} = 3.\\
  \item
    The \texttt{Weights} field is always zero (this field is not used in ROI analysis).

  The \texttt{FP} (or \texttt{NL}) worksheet - this lists the ratings of ROI-level-normal regions.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For \texttt{ReaderID} = 1, \texttt{ModalityID} = 1 and \texttt{CaseID} = 1 there are 4 rows, corresponding to the 4 ROI-level-normal regions in this case. The corresponding ratings are . The pattern repeats for other treatments and readers, but the rating are, of course, different.\\
  \item
    Each \texttt{CaseID} is represented in the \texttt{FP} worksheet (a rare exception could occur if a case-level abnormal case has 4 abnormal regions).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \texttt{TP} (or \texttt{LL}) worksheet - this lists the ratings of ROI-level-abnormal regions.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Because normal cases generate TPs, one does not find any entry with \texttt{CaseID} = 1-50 in the \texttt{TP} worksheet.\\
  \item
    The lowest \texttt{CaseID} in the \texttt{TP} worksheet is 51, which corresponds to the first abnormal case.\\
  \item
    There are two entries for this case, corresponding to the two ROI-level-abnormal regions present in this case. Recall that corresponding to this \texttt{CaseID} in the \texttt{Truth} worksheet there were two entries with \texttt{LesionID} = 2 and 3. These must match the \texttt{LesionID}'s listed for this case in the \texttt{TP} worksheet. Complementing these two entries, in the \texttt{FP} worksheet for \texttt{CaseID} = 51, there are 2 entries corresponding to the two ROI-level-normal regions in this case.\\
  \item
    One should be satisfied that for each abnormal case the sum of the number of entries in the \texttt{TP} and \texttt{FP} worksheets is always 4.

  One can think of the ROI paradigm as similar to the FROC paradigm, but with localization accuracy restricted to belonging to a region (one cannot distinguish multiple lesions within a region). The ROIs are defined prior to the study and made known to all observers participating in the study. Unlike the FROC paradigm, a \textbf{rating is required for every ROI}.
