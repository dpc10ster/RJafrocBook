# Preface {-}
* This book, an extended documentation of the __RJafroc__ package, is currently (as of April 2020) in preperation. It is intended to bypass the file size limits of __CRAN__, which severely limits the extent of the documentation that can be included with the CRAN package.


# A note on the online distribution mechanism of the book {-}
* In the hard-copy version of my book [@RN2680] the online distribution mechanisms was `BitBucket`. 
* `BitBucket` allows code sharing within a _closed_ group of a few users (e.g., myself and a student). 
* Since the purpose of open-source code is to encourage collaborations, this was, in hindsight, an unfortunate choice. Moreover, as my experience with R-packages grew, it became apparent to me that the vast majority of R-packages are shared on `GitHub`, not `BitBucket`. 
* For these reasons I have switched to `GitHub`. Any previous instructions pertaining to `BitBucket` are obsolete.
* In order to access `GitHub` material one needs to create a (free) account. 
* Go to [this link](https://github.com) and click on `Sign Up`.

# Contributing to this book {-}
* I would greatly appreciate any feedback on this document. I welcome corrections and comments.  
* The simplest way to do this is to raise an `Issue` on the [`GitHub` interface](https://github.com/dpc10ster/RJafrocBook). 
* Click on `Issues` tab under `dpc10ster/RJafrocBook`, then click on `New issue`.
* Contributions from users then automatically become part of the `GitHub` documentation/history of the book.
