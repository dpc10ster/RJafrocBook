# Preface
* This book, an extended documentation of the __RJafroc__ package, is undergoing extensive edits. 
* It should not be used by the casual user until I give the go ahead.
* It bypasses the file size limits of __CRAN__, currently 5 MB, which severely limits the extent of the documentation that can be included with the CRAN version of the package.
* I welcome corrections and comments by the not-so-casual-user.
* Please use the GitHub website to raise issues and comments:
