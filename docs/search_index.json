Parts labeled TBA need to be updated on final revision. It is intended as an online update to my “physical” book (Chakraborty 2017). Since its publication in 2017 the RJafroc package, on which the R code examples in the book depend, has evolved considerably, causing many of the examples to “break”. This also gives me the opportunity to improve on the book and include additional material. The physical book chapters are labeled (book), to distinguish them from the chapters in this online book.

BitBucket allows code sharing within a closed group of a few users (e.g., myself and a grad student). Since the purpose of open-source code is to encourage collaborations, this was, in hindsight, an unfortunate choice. Moreover, as my experience with R-packages grew, it became apparent that the vast majority of R-packages are shared on GitHub, not BitBucket. For these reasons I have switched to GitHub. All previous instructions pertaining to BitBucket are obsolete. In order to access GitHub material one needs to create a (free) GitHub account. Go to this link and click on Sign Up. REFERENCES "],
