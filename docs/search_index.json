Because the method depends on the assumption that jackknife pseudovalues can be regarded as independent and identically distributed case-level figures of merit, it has been criticized by Hillis who states that the method “works” but lacks firm statistical foundations (Hillis et al. 2005; Hillis 2007; Hillis, Berbaum, and Metz 2008). I believes that if a method “works” there must be good reasons why it “works” and the last section of the previous chapter, §9.13, gave a justification for why the method “works”. Specifically, the empirical AUC pseudovalues qualify as case-level FOM-like quantities; this property was also noted in 1997 by Hanley and Hajian-Tilaki (Hajian-Tilaki et al. 1997). However, this justification only applies to the empirical AUC, so an alternate approach is desirable. This chapter presents Hillis’ preferred alternative to the DBMH approach. He has argued that the DBMH method can be regarded as a “working model that gives the right results”, but a method based on an earlier publication (Obuchowski and Rockette 1995) by Obuchowski and Rockette, which does not depend on pseudovalues, and predicts more or less the same results, is preferable from a conceptual viewpoint. Since, besides showing the correspondence, Hillis has made significant improvements to the original methodology, this chapter is named “ORH Analysis”, where ORH stands for Obuchowski, Rockette and Hillis. The ORH method has advantages in being able to handle more complex study designs (Hillis 2014) that are outside the scope of this book (the author acknowledges a private communication from Dr. Obuchowski, ca. 2006, that demonstrates the flexibility afforded by the OR approach) and it is possible that applications to other paradigms (e.g., the FROC paradigm uses a rather different FOM from empirical ROC-AUC) are better performed with the ORH method. This chapter starts with a “gentle” introduction to the Obuchowski and Rockette method. The reason for the “gentle” introduction is that the method was rather opaque to me, an I suspect, most users. Part of the problem, in my opinion, is the notation, namely lack of usage of the case-set index \\(\\{c\\}\\), whose absence can be confusing. The notational issue is highlighted in a key difference of the Obuchowski and Rockette method from DBMH, namely in how the error term is modeled by a covariance matrix. In this chapter the structure of the covariance matrix is examined in some detail, as it is key to understanding the ORH method. In the first step of the gentle introduction a single reader interpreting a case-set in multiple treatments is modeled and the results compared to those obtained using DBMH fixed-reader analysis described in the previous chapter. In the second step multiple readers interpreting a case-set in multiple treatments is modeled. The two analyses, DBMH and ORH, are compared for the same dataset. The special cases of fixed-reader and fixed-case analyses are described. Single treatment analysis, where interest is in comparing average performance of readers to a fixed value, is described. Three methods of estimating the covariance matrix are described. 8.2 Single-reader multiple-treatment model Consider a single-reader providing ROC interpretations of a common case-set \\(\\{c\\}\\) in multiple-treatments \\(i\\) (\\(i\\) = 1, 2, …, \\(I\\)). Before proceeding, we note that this is not homologous (i.e., formally equivalent) to multiple-readers providing ROC interpretations in a single treatment, §10.7; this is because reader is a random factor while treatment is not. The figure of merit \\(\\theta\\) is modeled as: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\theta_{i\\{c\\}}=\\mu+\\tau_i+\\epsilon_{i\\{c\\}} \\end{equation*}\\] In the Obuchowski and Rockette method (Obuchowski and Rockette 1995) one models the figure-of-merit, not the pseudovalues, indeed this is one of the key differences from the DBMH method. Recall that \\(\\{c\\}\\) denotes a set of cases. Eqn. (10.1) models the observed figure-of-merit \\(\\theta_{i\\{c\\}}\\) as a constant term \\(\\mu\\) plus a treatment dependent term \\(\\tau_i\\) (the treatment-effect) with the constraint: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\tau_i=0 \\end{equation*}\\] The c-index was introduced in (book) Chapter 07. The left hand side of Eqn. (10.1) is the figure-of-merit \\(\\theta_i\\{c\\}\\) for treatment \\(i\\) and case-set index \\(\\{c\\}\\), where \\(c\\) = 1, 2, …, \\(C\\) denotes different independent case-sets sampled from the population, i.e., different collections of \\(K_1\\) non-diseased and \\(K_2\\) diseased cases, not individual cases. This is one place the case-set index is essential for clarity; without it \\(\\theta_i\\) is a fixed quantity - the figure of merit estimate for treatment \\(i\\) - lacking any index allowing for sampling related variability. Obuchowski and Rockette use a k-index, defined as the “kth repetition of the study involving the same diagnostic test, reader and patient (sic)”. In the author’s opinion, what is meant is a case-set index instead of a repetition index. Repeating a study with the same treatment, reader and cases yields within-reader variability, which is different from sampling the population of cases with new case-sets, which yields case-sampling plus within-reader variability. As noted earlier, within-reader variability cannot be “turned off” and affects the interpretations of all case-sets. Interest is in extrapolating to the population of cases and the only way to do this is to sample different case-sets. It is shown below that usage of the case-set index interpretation yields the same results using the DBMH or the ORH methods. Finally, and this is where I had some difficulty understanding what is going on, there is an additive random error term whose sampling behavior is described by a multivariate normal distribution with an I-dimensional zero mean vector and an I x I dimensional covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\): \\[\\begin{equation*} \\epsilon_{i\\{c\\}} \\sim N_I\\left ( \\vec{0} , \\Sigma\\right ) \\end{equation*}\\] Here \\(N_I\\) is the I-variate normal distribution (i.e., each sample yields \\(I\\) random numbers). Obuchowski and Rockette assumed the following structure for the covariance matrix (they describe a more general model, but here one restricts to the simpler one): \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Sigma=Cov\\left ( \\epsilon_{i\\{c\\}}, \\epsilon_{{i&#39;}\\{c\\}} \\right )\\\\ =Var \\Rightarrow i=i&#39;\\\\ =Cov_1 \\Rightarrow i\\neq i&#39; \\end{equation*}\\] The reason for the subscript “1” in \\(Cov_1\\) will become clear when one extends this model to multiple readers. The \\(I \\times I\\) covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) is: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Sigma= \\begin{pmatrix} Var &amp; Cov_1 &amp; \\ldots &amp; Cov_1 &amp; Cov_1 \\\\ Cov_1 &amp; Var &amp; \\ldots &amp;Cov_1 &amp; Cov_1 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ Cov_1 &amp; Cov_1 &amp; \\ldots &amp; Var &amp; Cov_1 \\\\ Cov_1 &amp; Cov_1 &amp; \\ldots &amp; Cov_1 &amp; Var \\end{pmatrix} \\end{equation*}\\] If \\(I\\) = 2 then \\(\\Sigma\\) is a symmetric 2 x 2 matrix, whose diagonal terms are the common variances in the two treatments (each assumed equal to \\(Var\\)) and whose off-diagonal terms (each assumed equal to \\(Cov_1\\)) are the co-variances. With \\(I\\) = 3 one has a 3 x 3 symmetric matrix with all diagonal elements equal to \\(Var\\) and all off-diagonal terms are equal to \\(Cov_1\\), etc. An important aspect of the Obuchowski and Rockette model is that the variances and co-variances are assumed to be treatment independent. This implies that \\(Var\\) estimates need to be averaged over all treatments. Likewise, \\(Cov_1\\) estimates need to be averaged over all distinct treatment-treatment pairings. A more complex model, with more parameters and therefore more difficult to work with, would allow the variances to be treatment dependent, and the covariances to depend on the specific treatment pairings. For obvious reasons (“Occam’s Razor” or the law of parsimony ) one wishes to start with the simplest model that, one hopes, captures essential characteristics of the data. Some elementary statistical results are presented next. 8.2.1 Definitions of covariance and correlation This section provides an overview of the steps involved in analysis of MRMC data. Two approaches are described in parallel: a figure of merit (FOM) derived jackknife pseudovalue based approach, detailed in this chapter and an FOM based approach, detailed in the next chapter. The analysis proceeds as follows: A FOM is selected: the selection of FOM is the single-most critical aspect of analyzing an observer performance study. The selected FOM is denoted \\(\\theta\\). To keep the notation reasonably compact the usual circumflex “hat” symbol used previously to denote an estimate is suppressed. The FOM has to be an objective scalar measure of performance with larger values characterizing better performance. [The qualifier “larger” is trivially satisfied; if the figure of merit has the opposite characteristic, a sign change is all that is needed to bring it back to compliance with this requirement.] Examples are empirical \\(AUC\\), the binormal model-based estimate \\(A_z\\) , other advance method based estimates of \\(AUC\\), sensitivity at a predefined value of specificity, etc. An example of a FOM requiring a sign-change is \\(FPF\\) at a specified \\(TPF\\), where smaller values signify better performance. For each treatment \\(i\\) and reader \\(j\\) the figure of merit \\(\\theta_{ij}\\) is estimated from the ratings data. Repeating this over all treatments and readers yields a matrix of observed values \\(\\theta_{ij}\\). This is averaged over all readers in each treatment yielding \\(\\theta_{i\\bullet}\\). The observed effect-size \\(ES_{obs}\\) is defined as the difference between the reader-averaged FOMs in the two treatments, i.e., \\(ES_{obs}\\) = \\(\\theta_{2\\bullet}\\) - \\(\\theta_{1\\bullet}\\). While extensible to more than two treatments, the explanation is more transparent by restricting to two modalities. If the magnitude of \\(ES_{obs}\\) is “large” one has reason to suspect that there might indeed be a significant difference in AUCs between the two treatments, where significant is used in the sense of (book) Chapter 08. Quantification of this statement, specifically how large is “large”, requires the conceptually more complex steps described next. In the DBMH approach, the subject of this chapter, jackknife pseudovalues are calculated as described in Chapter 08. A standard ANOVA model with uncorrelated errors is used to model the pseudovalues. In the ORH approach, the subject of the next chapter, the FOM is modeled directly using a custom ANOVA model with correlated errors. Depending on the selected method of modeling the data (pseudovalue vs. FOM) a statistical model is used which includes parameters modeling the true values in each treatment, and expected variations due to different variability components in the model, e.g., between-reader variability, case-sampling variability, interactions (e.g., modeling the possibility that the random effect of a given reader could be treatment dependent) and the presence of correlations (between pseudovalues or FOMs) because of the pairings inherent in the interpretations. In RRRC analysis one accounts for randomness in readers and cases. In FRRC analysis one regards reader as a fixed factor. In RRFC analysis one regards case as a fixed factor. The statistical model depends on the type of analysis. The parameters of the statistical model are estimated from the observed data. The estimates are used to infer the statistical distribution of the observed effect size, \\(ES_{obs}\\), regarded as a realization of a random variable, under the null hypothesis (NH) that the true effect size is zero. Based on this statistical distribution, and assuming a two-sided test, the probability (this is the oft-quoted p-value) of obtaining an effect size at least as extreme as that actually observed, is calculated, as in Chapter 08. If the p-value is smaller than a preselected value, denoted \\(\\alpha\\), one declares the treatments different at the \\(\\alpha\\) - significance level. The quantity \\(\\alpha\\) is the control (or cap) on the probability of making a Type I error, defined as rejecting the NH when it is true. It is common to set \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05 but depending on the severity of the consequences of a Type I error, as discussed in (book) Chapter 08, one might consider choosing a different value. Notice that \\(\\alpha\\) is a pre-selected number while the p-value is a realization of a random variable. For a valid statistical analysis, the empirical probability \\(\\alpha_{emp}\\) over many (typically 2000) independent NH datasets, that the p-value is smaller than \\(\\alpha\\), should equal \\(\\alpha\\) to within statistical uncertainty. 8.3 The Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz (DBM) method The figure-of-merit has three indices: 1. A treatment index \\(i\\), where \\(i\\) runs from 1 to \\(I\\), where \\(I\\) is the total number of treatments. 1. A reader index \\(j\\), where \\(j\\) runs from 1 to \\(J\\), where \\(J\\) is the total number of readers. 1. The often-suppressed case-sample index \\(\\{c\\}\\), where \\(\\{1\\}\\) i.e., \\(c\\) = 1, denotes a set of cases, \\(K_1\\) non-diseased and \\(K_2\\) diseased, interpreted by all readers in all treatments, and other integer values of \\(c\\) correspond to other independent sets of cases that, although not in fact interpreted by the readers, could potentially be “interpreted” using resampling methods such as the bootstrap or the jackknife. The approach (Dorfman, Berbaum, and Metz 1992) taken by Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz (DBM) was to use the jackknife resampling method described in (book) Chapter 7 to calculate FOM pseudovalues \\({Y&#39;}_{ijk}\\) defined by (the reason for the prime will become clear shortly): \\[\\begin{equation*} Y&#39;_{ijk}=K\\theta_{ij}-(K-1)\\theta_{ij\\{k\\}} \\end{equation*}\\] Here \\(\\theta_{ij}\\) is the estimate of the figure-of-merit for reader \\(j\\) interpreting all cases in treatment \\(i\\) and \\(\\theta_{ij\\{k\\}}\\) is the corresponding figure of merit with case \\(k\\) deleted from the analysis. To adhere to convention and to keep the notation simple the \\(\\{1\\}\\) index on every figure of merit symbol is suppressed (unless it is absolutely necessary for clarity). Recall from book Chapter 07 that the jackknife is a way of teasing out the case-dependence: the left hand side of Eqn. (9.1) literally has a case index \\(k\\), with \\(k\\) running from 1 to \\(K\\), where \\(K\\) is the total number of cases: \\(K=K_1+K_2\\). Hillis has proposed a centering transformation on the pseudovalues (Hillis calls them “normalized” pseudovalues but to the author “centering” is a more accurate and descriptive term - Normalize: (In mathematics) multiply (a series, function, or item of data) by a factor that makes the norm or some associated quantity such as an integral equal to a desired value (usually 1). New Oxford American Dictionary, 2016): \\[\\begin{equation*} Y_{ijk}=Y&#39;_{ijk}+\\left (\\theta_{ij} - Y&#39;_{ij\\bullet} \\right ) \\end{equation*}\\] Note: the bullet symbol denotes an average over the corresponding index. The effect of this transformation is that the average of the centered pseudovalues over the case index is identical to the corresponding estimate of the figure of merit: \\[\\begin{equation*} Y_{ij\\bullet}=Y&#39;_{ij\\bullet}+\\left (\\theta_{ij} - Y&#39;_{ij\\bullet} \\right )=\\theta_{ij} \\end{equation*}\\] This has the advantage that all confidence intervals are correctly centered. The transformation is unnecessary if one uses the Wilcoxon as the figure-of-merit, as the pseudovalues calculated using the Wilcoxon as the figure of merit are automatically centered. It is left as an exercise for the reader to show that this statement is true. It is understood that, unless explicitly stated otherwise, all calculations from now on will use centered pseudovalues. Consider \\(N\\) replications of a MRMC study, where a replication means repetition of the study with the same treatments, readers and case-set \\(\\{1\\}\\). For \\(N\\) replications per treatment-reader-case combination, the DBM model for the pseudovalues is (\\(n\\) is the replication index, usually \\(n\\) = 1, but kept here for now): \\[\\begin{equation*} Y_{n(ijk)} = \\mu + \\tau_i+ R_j + C_k + (\\tau R)_{ij}+ (\\tau C)_{ik}+ (R C)_{jk} + (\\tau RC)_{ijk}+ \\epsilon_{n(ijk)} \\end{equation*}\\] The term \\(\\mu\\) is a constant. By definition, the treatment effect \\(\\tau_i\\) is subject to the constraint: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\tau_i=0\\Rightarrow \\tau_\\bullet=0 \\end{equation*}\\] It is shown below, Eqn. (9.9), that this constraint ensures that \\(\\mu\\) has the interpretation as the average of the pseudovalues over treatments, readers, cases and replications, if any. The notation for the replication index, i.e., \\(n(ijk)\\), implies \\(n\\) observations for treatment-reader-case combination \\(ijk\\). With no replications (\\(N\\) = 1) it is convenient to omit the n-symbol. As an example, the parameter \\(\\tau_i\\) is readily estimated as follows: \\[\\begin{equation*} Y_{ijk}\\equiv Y_{1(ijk)}\\\\ \\tau_i = Y_{i \\bullet \\bullet} -Y_{\\bullet \\bullet \\bullet} \\end{equation*}\\] The basic assumption of the DBM model, Eqn. (9.4), is that the pseudovalues can be regarded as independent and identically distributed observations. That being the case, the pseudovalues can be analyzed by standard ANOVA techniques. 8.3.1 Explanation of terms in the model The right hand side of Eqn. (9.4) consists of one fixed and 7 random effects. The current analysis assumes readers and cases as random factors (RRRC), so by definition \\(R_j\\) and \\(C_k\\) are random effects, and moreover, any term that includes a random factor is a random effect; for example, \\((\\tau R)_{ij}\\) is a random effect because it includes the \\(R\\) factor. Here is a list of the random terms: \\[\\begin{equation*} R_j, C_k, (\\tau R)_{ij}, (\\tau C)_{ik}, (RC)_{jk}, (\\tau RC)_{ijk}, \\epsilon_{ijk} \\end{equation*}\\] Assumption: Each of the random effects is modeled as a random sample from mutually independent zero-mean normal distributions with variances as specified below: \\[\\begin{equation*} R_j \\sim N\\left ( 0,\\sigma_{R}^{2} \\right ) \\\\ C_k \\sim N\\left ( 0,\\sigma_{C}^{2} \\right ) \\\\ (\\tau R)_{ij} \\sim N\\left ( 0,\\sigma_{\\tau R}^{2} \\right ) \\\\ (\\tau C)_{ik} \\sim N\\left ( 0,\\sigma_{\\tau C}^{2} \\right ) \\\\ (RC)_{jk} \\sim N\\left ( 0,\\sigma_{RC}^{2} \\right ) \\\\ (\\tau RC)_{ijk} \\sim N\\left ( 0,\\sigma_{\\tau RC}^{2} \\right ) \\\\ \\epsilon_{ijk} \\sim N\\left ( 0,\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2} \\right ) \\end{equation*}\\] One could have placed a \\(Y\\) subscript (or superscript) on each of the variances, as they describe fluctuations of the pseudovalues, not FOM values – the latter are the subject of the next chapter. However, this tends to make the notation cumbersome. So here is the convention: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all variance symbols in this chapter refer to pseudovalues. Another convention: \\((\\tau R)_{ij}\\) is not the product of the treatment and reader factors, rather it is a single factor, namely the treatment-reader factor with \\(IJ\\) levels, subscripted by the index \\(ij\\) and similarly for the other product-like terms in Eqn. (9.7). 8.3.2 Meanings of variance components in the DBM model (TBA this section can be improved) The variances defined in Eqn. (9.7) are collectively termed variance components. Specifically, they are jackknife pseudovalue variance components, to be distinguished from figure of merit (FOM) variance components to be introduced in Chapter 10. They are in order: \\(\\sigma_{R}^{2} ,\\sigma_{C}^{2} \\sigma_{\\tau R}^{2},\\sigma_{\\tau C}^{2},\\sigma_{RC}^{2}, \\sigma_{\\tau RC}^{2},\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\). They have the following meanings (all references to “variance” mean “variance of pseudovalues”). The term \\(\\sigma_{R}^{2}\\) is the variance of readers that is independent of treatment or case, which are modeled separately. It is not to be confused with the terms \\(\\sigma_{br+wr}^{2}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{cs+wr}^{2}\\) used in §9.3, which describe the variability of \\(\\theta\\) measured under specified conditions. [A jackknife pseudovalue is a weighted difference of FOM like quantities, Eqn. (9.1). Its meaning will be explored later. For now, a pseudovalue variance is distinct from a FOM variance.] The term \\(\\sigma_{C}^{2}\\) is the variance of cases that is independent of treatment or reader. The term \\(\\sigma_{\\tau R}^{2}\\) is the treatment-dependent variance of readers that was excluded in the definition of \\(\\sigma_{R}^{2}\\). If one were to sample readers and treatments for the same case-set, the net variance would be \\(\\sigma_{R}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\tau R}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\). The term \\(\\sigma_{\\tau C}^{2}\\) is the treatment-dependent variance of cases that was excluded in the definition of \\(\\sigma_{C}^{2}\\). So, if one were to sample cases and treatments for the same readers, the net variance would be \\(\\sigma_{C}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\tau C}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\). The term \\(\\sigma_{RC}^{2}\\) is the treatment-independent variance of readers and cases that were excluded in the definitions of \\(\\sigma_{R}^{2}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{C}^{2}\\). So, if one were to sample readers and cases for the same treatment, the net variance would be \\(\\sigma_{R}^{2}+\\sigma_{C}^{2}+\\sigma_{RC}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\). The term \\(\\sigma_{\\tau RC}^{2}\\) is the variance of treatments, readers and cases that were excluded in the definitions of all the preceding terms in Eqn. (9.7). So, if one were to sample treatments, readers and cases the net variance would be \\(\\sigma_{R}^{2}+\\sigma_{C}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\tau C}^{2}+\\sigma_{RC}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\tau RC}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\). The last term, \\(\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\) describes the variance arising from different replications of the study using the same treatments, readers and cases. Measuring this variance requires repeating the study several (\\(N\\)) times with the same treatments, readers and cases, and computing the variance of \\(Y_{n(ijk)}\\) , where the additional \\(n\\)-index refers to true replications, \\(n\\) = 1, 2, …, \\(N\\). \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}=\\frac{1}{IJK}\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\sum_{k=1}^{k}\\frac{1}{N-1}\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\left ( Y_{n(ijk)} - Y_{\\bullet (ijk)} \\right )^2 \\end{equation*}\\] The right hand side of Eqn. (9.8) is the variance of \\(Y_{n(ijk)}\\), for specific \\(ijk\\), with respect to the replication index \\(n\\), averaged over all \\(ijk\\). In practice \\(N\\) = 1 (i.e., there are no replications) and this variance cannot be estimated (it would imply dividing by zero). It has the meaning of reader inconsistency, usually termed within-reader variability. As will be shown later, the presence of this inestimable term does not limit ones ability to perform significance testing on the treatment effect without having to replicate the whole study, as implied in earlier work (Obuchowski and Rockette 1995). An equation like Eqn. (9.7) is termed a linear model with the left hand side, the pseudovalue “observations”, modeled by a sum of fixed and random terms. Specifically it is a mixed model, because the right hand side has both fixed and random effects. Statistical methods have been developed for analysis of such linear models. One estimates the terms on the right hand side of Eqn. (9.7), it being understood that for the random effects, one estimates the variances of the zero-mean normal distributions, Eqn. (9.7), from which the samples are obtained (by assumption). Estimating the fixed effects is trivial. The term \\(\\mu\\) is estimated by averaging the left hand side of Eqn. (9.4) over all three indices (since \\(N\\) = 1): \\(\\mu=Y_{\\bullet \\bullet \\bullet}\\) Because of the way the treatment effect is defined, Eqn. (9.5), averaging, which involves summing, over the treatment-index \\(i\\), yields zero, and all of the remaining random terms yield zero upon averaging, because they are individually sampled from zero-mean normal distributions. To estimate the treatment effect one takes the difference \\(\\tau_i=Y_{\\bullet \\bullet \\bullet}-\\mu\\). It can be easily seen that the reader and case averaged difference between two different treatments \\(i\\) and \\(i&#39;\\) is estimated by \\(\\tau_i-\\tau_{i&#39;} = Y_{i \\bullet \\bullet} - Y_{i&#39; \\bullet \\bullet}\\). Estimating the strengths of the random terms is a little more complicated. It involves methods adapted from least squares, or maximum likelihood, and more esoteric ways. I do not feel comfortable going into these methods. Instead, results are presented and arguments are made to make them plausible. The starting point is definitions of quantities called mean squares and their expected values. 8.3.3 Definitions of mean-squares Again, to be clear, one should put a \\(Y\\) subscript (or superscript) on each of the following definitions, but that would make the notation unnecessarily cumbersome. In this chapter, all mean-square quantities are calculated using pseudovalues, not figure-of-merit values. The presence of three subscripts on Y should make this clear. Also the replication index and the nesting notation are suppressed. The notation is abbreviated so MST is the mean square corresponding to the treatment effect, etc. The definitions of the mean-squares below match those (when provided) in (Hillis and Berbaum 2004, 1261); the definition of \\(MS(R)\\) in (Hillis 2014, top of page 339) is incorrect. \\[\\begin{equation*} \\text{MS(T)}=\\frac{JK\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\left ( Y_{i \\bullet \\bullet} - Y_{ \\bullet \\bullet \\bullet} \\right )^2}{I-1} \\\\ \\text{MS(R)}=\\frac{IK\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\left ( Y_{\\bullet j \\bullet} - Y_{ \\bullet \\bullet \\bullet} \\right )^2}{J-1} \\\\ \\text{MS(C)}=\\frac{IJ\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\left ( Y_{\\bullet \\bullet k} - Y_{ \\bullet \\bullet \\bullet} \\right )^2}{K-1} \\\\ \\text{MS(TR)}=\\frac{K\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\left ( Y_{i j \\bullet} - Y_{i \\bullet \\bullet} - Y_{\\bullet j \\bullet} + Y_{ \\bullet \\bullet \\bullet} \\right )^2}{(I-1)(J-1)} \\\\ \\text{MS(TC)}=\\frac{J\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\left ( Y_{i \\bullet k} - Y_{i \\bullet \\bullet} - Y_{\\bullet \\bullet k} + Y_{ \\bullet \\bullet \\bullet} \\right )^2}{(I-1)(K-1)} \\\\ \\text{MS(RC)}=\\frac{I\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\left ( Y_{\\bullet j k} - Y_{\\bullet j \\bullet} - Y_{\\bullet \\bullet k} + Y_{ \\bullet \\bullet \\bullet} \\right )^2}{(J-1)(K-1)}\\\\ \\text{MS(TRC)}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\sum_{j=1}^{J}\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\left ( Y_{i j k} - Y_{i j \\bullet} - Y_{i \\bullet k} - Y_{\\bullet j k} + Y_{i \\bullet \\bullet} + Y_{\\bullet j \\bullet} + Y_{\\bullet \\bullet k} - Y_{ \\bullet \\bullet \\bullet} \\right )^2}{(I-1)(J-1)K-1)} \\end{equation*}\\] Note the absence of \\(MSE\\), corresponding to the \\(\\epsilon\\) term on the right hand side of Eqn. (9.4). With only one observation per treatment-reader-case combination, MSE cannot be estimated; it effectively gets folded into the \\(MS(TRC)\\) term. 8.4 Expected values of mean squares “In our original formulation [2], expected mean squares for the ANOVA were derived from a restricted parameterization in which mixed-factor interactions sum to zero over indexes of fixed effects. In the restricted parameterization, the mixed effects are correlated, parameters are sometimes awkward to define [17], and extension to unbalanced designs is dubious [17, 18]. In this article, we recommend the unrestricted parameterization. The restricted and unrestricted parameterizations are special cases of a general model by Scheffe [19] that allows an arbitrary covariance structure among experimental units within a level of a random factor. Tables 1 and 2 show the ANOVA tables with expected mean squares for the unrestricted formulation.” — (Dorfman, Berbaum, and Lenth 1995) The mean squares on the left hand side of Eqn. (9.12) can be calculated directly from the pseudovalues. The next step in the analysis is to obtain expressions for their expected values in terms of the variances defined in Eqn. (9.7). Assuming no replications, i.e., \\(N\\) = 1, the expected mean squares are as follows, Table 9.1; understanding how this table is derived, would lead the author well outside his expertise and the scope of this book; suffice to say that these are unconstrained estimates (as summarized in the quotation above) which are different from the constrained estimates appearing in the original DBM publication (Dorfman, Berbaum, and Metz 1992). Table 9.1 Unconstrained expected values of mean-squares, as in (Dorfman, Berbaum, and Lenth 1995) Source df E(MS) T (I-1) \\(\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\) + \\(\\sigma_{\\tau RC}^{2}\\) + \\(K\\sigma_{\\tau R}^{2}\\) + \\(J\\sigma_{\\tau C}^{2}\\) + \\(JK\\sigma_{\\tau}^{2}\\) R (J-1) \\(\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\) + \\(I\\sigma_{RC}^{2}\\) + \\(IK\\sigma_{R}^{2}\\) + \\(K\\sigma_{\\tau R}^{2}\\) C (K-1) \\(\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\) + \\(I\\sigma_{RC}^{2}\\) + \\(IJ\\sigma_{C}^{2}\\) + \\(J\\sigma_{\\tau C}^{2}\\) TR (I-1)(J-1) \\(\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\) + \\(\\sigma_{\\tau RC}^{2}\\) + \\(K\\sigma_{\\tau R}^{2}\\) TC (I-1)(K-1) \\(\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\) + \\(\\sigma_{\\tau RC}^{2}\\) + \\(J\\sigma_{\\tau C}^{2}\\) RC (J-1)(K-1) \\(\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\) + \\(I\\sigma_{RC}^{2}\\) TRC (I-1)(J-1)(K-1) \\(\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\) + \\(\\sigma_{\\tau RC}^{2}\\) \\(\\epsilon\\) \\(N-1=0\\) \\(\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}\\) In Tables 9.1 the following notation is used as a shorthand: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sigma_{\\tau}^{2}=\\frac{1}{I-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\left ( Y_{i \\bullet \\bullet} - Y_{\\bullet \\bullet \\bullet} \\right )^2 \\end{equation*}\\] Since treatment is a fixed effect, the variance symbol \\(\\sigma_{\\tau}^{2}\\), which is used for notational consistency in Tables 9.1 - 9.3, could cause confusion. The right hand side “looks like” a variance, indeed one that could be calculated for just two treatments but, of course, random sampling from a distribution of treatments is not the intent of the notation. With this explanation, I trust the reader will not be confused. 8.5 Random-reader random-case (RRRC) analysis Both readers and cases are regarded as random factors. The expected mean squares in Table 9.1 are variance-like quantities; specifically, they are weighted linear combinations of the variances appearing in Eqn. (9.7). For single factors the column headed “degrees of freedom” (\\(df\\)) is one less than the number of levels of the corresponding factor; estimating a variance requires first estimating the mean, which imposes a constraint, thereby decreasing \\(df\\) by one. For interaction terms, \\(df\\) is the product of the degrees of freedom for the individual factors. As an example, the term \\((\\tau RC)_{ijk}\\) contains three individual factors, and therefore \\(df = (I-1)(J-1)(K-1)\\). The number of degrees of freedom can be thought of as the amount of information available in estimating a mean square. As a special case, with no replications, the \\(\\epsilon\\) term has zero \\(df\\) as \\(N-1 = 0\\). With only one observation \\(Y_{1(ijk)}\\) there is no information to estimate the variance corresponding to the \\(\\epsilon\\) term. To estimate this term one needs to replicate the study several times – each time the same readers interpret the same cases in all treatments – a very boring task for the reader and totally unnecessary from the researcher’s point of view. 8.5.1 Example 1: Calculation of mean squares We choose dataset02 to illustrate calculation of mean squares for pseudovalues. This is referred to in the book as the “VD” dataset (Van Dyke et al. 1993). It consists of 114 cases, 45 of which are diseased, interpreted in two treatments (“0” = single spin echo MRI, “1” = cine-MRI) by five radiologists using the ROC paradigm. The first line below computes the pseudovalues and extracts the numbers of treatmenets, readers and cases, used in the subsequent calculations of mean squares.

Therefore, one defines the following statistic, denoted \\(F_{DBM}\\), using the observed values of the mean squares, calculated almost trivially using Eqn. (9.12): \\[\\begin{equation*} F_{DBM} = \\frac{MS(T)}{MS(TR) + MS(TC) - MS(TRC)} \\end{equation*}\\] \\(F_{DBM}\\) is a realization of a random variable. A non-zero treatment effect, i.e., \\(\\sigma_{\\tau}^{2} &gt; 0\\), will cause the ratio to be larger than one, because \\(E\\left ( MS(T) \\right)\\) will be larger, see row labeled \\(T\\) in Table 9.1. Therefore values of \\(F_{DBM} &gt; 1\\) will tend to reject the NH. Drawing on a theorem from statistics (Larsen and Marx 2001), under the NH the ratio of two independent mean squares is distributed as a (central) F-statistic with degrees of freedom corresponding to those of the mean squares forming the numerator and denominator of the ratio (Theorem 12.2.5 in “An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications”). Knowing the distribution of the statistic defined by (9.18) under the NH enables hypothesis testing. This is completely analogous to Chapter 08 where knowledge of the distribution of AUC under the NH enabled testing the null hypothesis that the observed value of AUC equals a pre-specified value. Under the NH the left hand side of by (9.18), i.e., \\(F_{DBM}\\), is distributed according to the F-distribution characterized by two numbers: A numerator degrees of freedom (\\(ndf\\)) – determined by the degrees of freedom of the numerator \\(MST\\) of the ratio comprising the F-statistic, i.e., \\(I – 1\\), and A denominator degrees of freedom (\\(ddf\\)) - determined by the degrees of freedom of the denominator of the ratio comprising the F-statistic, to be described below. Summarizing, \\[\\begin{equation*} F_{DBM} \\sim F_{ndf,ddf} \\\\ ndf=I-1 \\end{equation*}\\] The next topic is estimating \\(ddf\\). 8.5.3 The Satterthwaite approximation The denominator of the F-ratio is MS(TR)+MS(TC)-MS(TRC). This is not a simple mean square. Rather it is a linear combination of mean squares (with coefficients 1, 1 and 1), and the resulting value could even be negative, which is an illegal value for a sample from an F-distribution. In 1941 Satterthwaite (Satterthwaite 1941, 1946) proposed an approximate degree of freedom for a linear combination of simple mean square quantities. Online Appendix 9.A explains the approximation in more detail. The end result is that the mean square quantity described in Eqn. (9.21) has an approximate degree of freedom defined by (this is called the Satterthwaite’s approximation): \\[\\begin{equation*} ddf_{Sat}=\\frac{\\left ( MS(TR) + MS(TC) - MS(TRC) \\right )^2}{\\left ( \\frac{MS(TR)^2}{(I-1)(J-1)} + \\frac{MS(TC)^2}{(I-1)(K-1)} + \\frac{MS(TRC)^2}{(I-1)(J-1)(K-1)} \\right )} \\end{equation*}\\] The subscript \\(Sat\\) is for Satterthwaite. From Eqn. (9.22) it should be fairly obvious that in general \\(ddf_{Sat}\\) is not an integer. To accommodate possible negative estimates of the denominator, Eqn. (9.21), the original DBM method (Dorfman, Berbaum, and Metz 1992) proposed four expressions for the F-statistic and corresponding expressions for \\(ddf\\). Rather than repeat them here, since they have been superseded by the method described below, the interested reader is referred to Eqn. 6 and Eqn. 7 in (Hillis, Berbaum, and Metz 2008). Hillis (Hillis 2007) proposes the following statistic for testing the null hypothesis (the subscript \\(DBMH\\) give credit to the original formulation by DBM and the subsequent improvements by Hillis): \\[\\begin{equation*} F_{DBMH} = \\frac{MS(T)}{MS(TR) + \\max \\left (MS(TC) - MS(TRC), 0 \\right )} \\end{equation*}\\] Now the denominator cannot be negative. One can think of the F-statistic \\(F_{DBMH}\\) as a signal-to-noise ratio like quantity, with the difference that both numerator and denominator are variance like quantities. If the “variance” represented by the treatment effect is larger than the variance of the noise tending to mask the treatment effect, then \\(F_{DBMH}\\) tends to be large, which makes the observed treatment “variance” stand out more clearly compared to the noise. Hillis has shown that the left hand side of Eqn. (9.23) is distributed as an F-statistic with ndf defined by Eqn. (9.20), and denominator degrees of freedom defined by: \\[\\begin{equation*} ddf_H =\\frac{\\left ( MS(TR) + \\max \\left (MS(TC) - MS(TRC),0 \\right ) \\right )^2}{\\left ( \\frac{MS(TR)^2}{(I-1)(J-1)} \\right )} \\end{equation*}\\] Summarizing, \\[\\begin{equation*} F_{DBM} \\sim F_{ndf,ddf} \\\\ ndf=I-1 \\end{equation*}\\] Instead of 4 rules, as in the original DBM method, the Hillis modification involves just one rule, summarized by Eqns. (9.23) through Eqn. (9.25). Moreover, the F-statistic is constrained to non-negative values. Using simulation testing (Hillis, Berbaum, and Metz 2008) has shown that the DBMH method has better null hypothesis behavior than the original DBM method; the latter tended to be too conservative, typically yielding Type I error rates smaller than the optimal 5%. 8.5.4 Decision rules, p-value and confidence intervals The critical value of the F-statistic \\(F_{1-\\alpha,ndf,ddf_H}\\) is defined such that fraction of the distribution lies to the left of the critical value, in other words it is the quantile function for the F-distribution: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr\\left ( F\\leq F_{1-\\alpha,ndf,ddf_H} \\mid F\\sim F_{ndf,ddf_H}\\right ) = 1 - \\alpha \\end{equation*}\\] The critical value \\(F_{1-\\alpha,ndf,ddf_H}\\) increases as \\(\\alpha\\) decreases. The value of \\(\\alpha\\), generally chosen to be 0.05, termed the nominal \\(\\alpha\\), is fixed. The decision rule is that if \\(F_{DBMH} &gt; F_{1-\\alpha, ndf, ddf_H}\\) one rejects the NH and otherwise one does not. It follows, from the definition of \\(F_{DBMH}\\), Eqn. (9.23), that rejection of the NH is more likely if: * \\(F_{DBMH}\\) is large, Eqn. (9.18), which occurs if \\(MS(T)\\) is large, meaning the treatment effect is large, and / or \\(MS(TR) + \\max \\left (MS(TC) - MS(TRC),0 \\right )\\) is small, see comments following Eqn. (9.23). * \\(\\alpha\\) is large: for then \\(F_{1-\\alpha,ndf,ddf_H}\\) decreases and is more likely to be exceeded by \\(F_{DBMH}\\). * ndf is large: the more the number of treatment pairings, the greater the chance that at least one pairing will reject the NH. * \\(ddf_H\\) is large: this causes the critical value to decrease, see below, and is more likely to be exceeded by \\(F_{DBMH}\\). 8.5.4.1 Example 2: Code illustrating the F-distribution for different arguments See BACKGROUND ON THE F-DISTRIBUTION. 8.5.4.2 p-value and confidence interval **The p-value of the test is the probability, under the NH, that an equal or larger value of the F-statistic than \\(F_{DBMH}\\) could occur by chance. In other words, it is the area under the (central) F-distribution \\(F_{ndf,ddf}\\) that lies above the observed value \\(F_{DBMH}\\): \\[\\begin{equation*} p=\\Pr\\left ( F &gt; F_{DBMH} \\mid F \\sim F_{ndf,ddf_H} \\right ) \\end{equation*}\\] If \\(p &lt; \\alpha\\) then the NH that all treatments are identical is rejected at significance level \\(\\alpha\\). That informs the researcher that there exists at least one treatment-pair that has a significant difference. To identify which pair(s) are different, one calculates confidence intervals for each paired difference. Hillis has shown that the \\((1-\\alpha)\\) percent confidence interval for \\(Y_{i \\bullet \\bullet} - Y_{i&#39; \\bullet \\bullet}\\) is given by: \\[\\begin{equation*} CI_{1-\\alpha}=\\left ( Y_{i \\bullet \\bullet} - Y_{i&#39; \\bullet \\bullet} \\right ) \\pm t_{\\alpha/2;ddf_H} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{JK}\\left ( MS(TR) + \\max\\left ( MS(TC)-MS(TRC),0 \\right ) \\right )} \\end{equation*}\\] Here \\(t_{\\alpha/2;ddf_H}\\) is that value such that \\(\\alpha/2\\) of the central t-distribution with \\(ddf_H\\) degrees of freedom is contained in the upper tail of the distribution: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\Pr\\left ( T&gt;t_{\\alpha/2;ddf_H} \\right )=\\alpha/2 \\end{equation*}\\] Since centered pseudovalues were used: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left ( Y_{i \\bullet \\bullet} - Y_{i&#39; \\bullet \\bullet} \\right )=\\left ( \\theta_{i \\bullet } - \\theta_{i&#39; \\bullet} \\right ) \\end{equation*}\\] Eqn. (9.28) can be rewritten: \\[\\begin{equation*} CI_{1-\\alpha}=\\left ( \\theta_{i \\bullet} - \\theta_{i&#39; \\bullet} \\right ) \\pm t_{\\alpha/2;ddf_H} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{JK}\\left ( MS(TR) + \\max\\left ( MS(TC)-MS(TRC),0 \\right ) \\right )} \\end{equation*}\\] For two treatments the following equivalent rules could be adopted to reject the NH: \\(F_{DBMH} &gt; F_{1-\\alpha,ndf,ddf_H}\\) \\(p &lt; \\alpha\\) \\(CI_{1-alpha}\\) excludes zero For more than two treatments the first two rules are equivalent and if a significant difference is found using either of them, then one can use the confidence intervals to determine which treatment pair differences are significantly different from zero. In this book the first F-test is called the overall F-test and the subsequent tests the treatment-pair t-tests. One only conducts treatment pair t-tests if the overall F-test yields a significant result. 8.5.4.3 Example 3: Code illustrating the F-statistic, ddf and p-value for RRRC analysis, Van Dyke data alpha &lt;- 0.05 retMS &lt;- data.frame(&quot;msT&quot; = msT, &quot;msR&quot; = msR, &quot;msC&quot; = msC, &quot;msTR&quot; = msTR, &quot;msTC&quot; = msTC, &quot;msRC&quot; = msRC, &quot;msTRC&quot; = msTRC) F_DBMH_den &lt;- retMS$msTR+max(retMS$msTC - retMS$msTRC,0) # den of Eqn.

The second row shows the corresponding RJafroc output. The FOM difference is not significant, whether viewed from the point of view of the F-statistic not exceeding the critical value, the observed p-value being larger than alpha or the 95% CI for the difference FOM including zero. 8.6 Fixed-reader random-case (FRRC) analysis The model is the same as in Eqn. (9.4) except one puts \\(\\sigma_{R}^{2}\\) = \\(\\sigma_{\\tau R}^{2}\\) = 0 in Table 9.1. The appropriate test statistic is: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\frac{E\\left ( MS(T) \\right )}{E\\left ( MS(TC) \\right )} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\tau RC}^{2}+J\\sigma_{\\tau C}^{2}+JK\\sigma_{\\tau}^{2}}{\\sigma_{\\epsilon}^{2}+\\sigma_{\\tau RC}^{2}+J\\sigma_{\\tau C}^{2}} \\end{equation*}\\] Under the null hypothesis \\(\\sigma_{\\tau}^{2} = 0\\): \\[\\begin{equation*} \\frac{E\\left ( MS(T) \\right )}{E\\left ( MS(TC) \\right )} = 1 \\end{equation*}\\] As before, one defines the F-statistic (by replacing expected with observed values) by \\[\\begin{equation*} F_{DBM|R}=\\frac{MS(T)}{MS(TC)} \\end{equation*}\\] The observed value \\(F_{DBM|R}\\) (the Roe-Metz notation (Roe and Metz 1997) is used which indicates that the factor appearing to the right of the vertical bar is regarded as fixed) is distributed as an F-statistic with \\(\\text{ndf}\\) = \\(I – 1\\) and \\(ddf = (I-1)(K-1)\\); the degrees of freedom follow from the rows labeled \\(T\\) and \\(TC\\) in Table 9.1. Therefore, the distribution of the observed value is (no Satterthwaite approximation needed this time as both numerator and denominator are simple mean-squares): \\[\\begin{equation*} F_{DBM|R} \\sim F_{I-1,(I-1)(K-1)} \\end{equation*}\\] The null hypothesis is rejected if the observed value of the F- statistic exceeds the critical value: \\[\\begin{equation*} F_{DBM|R} &gt; F_{1-\\alpha,I-1,(I-1)(K-1)} \\end{equation*}\\] The p-value of the test is the probability that a random sample from the F-distribution Eqn.

A reason for the level of detail is that almost all of the material carries over to other data collection paradigms, and a thorough understanding of the relatively simple ROC paradigm data is helpful to understanding the more complex ones. DBMH has been used in several hundred ROC studies (Prof. Kevin Berbaum, private communication ca. 2010). While the method allows generalization of a study finding, e.g., rejection of the NH, to the population of readers and cases, the author believes this is sometimes taken too literally. If a study is done at a single hospital, then the radiologists tend to be more homogenous as compared to sampling radiologists from different hospitals. This is because close interactions between radiologists at a hospital tend to homogenize reading styles and performance. A similar issue applies to patient characteristics, which are also expected to vary more between different geographical locations than within a given location served by the hospital. This means is that single hospital study based p-values may tend to be biased downwards, declaring differences that may not be replicable if a wider sampling “net” were used using the same sample size. The price paid for a wider sampling net is that one must use more readers and cases to achieve the same sensitivity to genuine treatment effects, i.e., statistical power (i.e., there is no “free-lunch”). A third MRMC ROC method, due to Clarkson, Kupinski and Barrett19,20, implemented in open-source JAVA software by Gallas and colleagues22,44 (http://didsr.github.io/iMRMC/) is available on the web. Clarkson et al19,20 provide a probabilistic rationale for the DBM model, provided the figure of merit is the empirical \\(AUC\\). The method is elegant but it is only applicable as long as one is using the empirical AUC as the figure of merit (FOM) for quantifying observer performance. In contrast the DBMH approach outlined in this chapter, and the approach outlined in the following chapter, are applicable to any scalar FOM. Broader applicability ensures that significance-testing methods described in this, and the following chapter, apply to other ROC FOMs, such as binormal model or other fitted AUCs, and more importantly, to other observer performance paradigms, such as free-response ROC paradigm. An advantage of the Clarkson et al. approach is that it predicts truth-state dependence of the variance components. One knows from modeling ROC data that diseased cases tend to have greater variance than non-diseased ones, and there is no reason to suspect that similar differences do not exist between the variance components. Testing validity of an analysis method via simulation testing is only as good as the simulator used to generate the datasets, and this is where current research is at a bottleneck. The simulator plays a central role in ROC analysis. In the author’s opinion this is not widely appreciated. In contrast, simulators are taken very seriously in other disciplines, such as cosmology, high-energy physics and weather forecasting. The simulator used to validate3 DBMH is that proposed by Roe and Metz39 in 1997. This simulator has several shortcomings. (a) It assumes that the ratings are distributed like an equal-variance binormal model, which is not true for most clinical datasets (recall that the b-parameter of the binormal model is usually less than one). Work extending this simulator to unequal variance has been published3. (b) It does not take into account that some lesions are not visible, which is the basis of the contaminated binormal model (CBM). A CBM model based simulator would use equal variance distributions with the difference that the distribution for diseased cases would be a mixture distribution with two peaks. The radiological search model (RSM) of free-response data, Chapter 16 &amp;17 also implies a mixture distribution for diseased cases, and it goes farther, as it predicts some cases yield no z-samples, which means they will always be rated in the lowest bin no matter how low the reporting threshold. Both CBM and RSM account for truth dependence by accounting for the underlying perceptual process. (c) The Roe-Metz simulator is out dated; the parameter values are based on datasets then available (prior to 1997). Medical imaging technology has changed substantially in the intervening decades. (d) Finally, the methodology used to arrive at the proposed parameter values is not clearly described. Needed is a more realistic simulator, incorporating knowledge from alternative ROC models and paradigms that is calibrated, by a clearly defined method, to current datasets. Since ROC studies in medical imaging have serious health-care related consequences, no method should be used unless it has been thoroughly validated. Much work still remains to be done in proper simulator design, on which validation is dependent. 8.13 Things for me to think about 8.13.1 Expected values of mean squares Assuming no replications the expected mean squares are as follows, Table 9.1; understanding how this table is derived, would lead the author well outside his expertise and the scope of this book; suffice to say that these are unconstrained estimates (as summarized in the quotation above) which are different from the constrained estimates appearing in the original DBM publication (Dorfman, Berbaum, and Metz 1992), Table 9.2; the differences between these two types of estimates is summarized in (Dorfman, Berbaum, and Lenth 1995). For reference, Table 9.3 is the table published in the most recent paper that I am aware of (Hillis 2014). All three tables are different! In this chapter I will stick to Table 9.1 for the subsequent development.
