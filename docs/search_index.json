Background on observer performance methods are in my book (Chakraborty 2017). I will start with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) data (Metz 1978), as this is by far the simplest paradigm. In the ROC paradigm the observer assigns a rating to each image. A rating is an ordered numeric label, and, in our convention, higher values represent greater certainty or confidence level for presence of disease. With human observers, a 5 (or 6) point rating scale is typically used, with 1 representing highest confidence for absence of disease and 5 (or 6) representing highest confidence for presence of disease. Intermediate values represent intermediate confidence levels for presence or absence of disease. Note that location information associated with the disease, if applicable, is not collected. There is no restriction to 5 or 6 ratings. With algorithmic observers, e.g., computer aided detection (CAD) algorithms, the rating could be a floating point number and have infinite precision. All that is required is that higher values correspond to greater confidence in presence of disease. 2.2 Note to existing users The Excel file format has recently undergone changes resulting in 4 extra list members in the final created dataset object (i.e., 12 members instead of 8). Code should run on the old format Excel files as the 4 extra list members are simply ignored. Reasons for the change will become clearer in these vignettes Basically they are needed for generalization to other data collection paradigms instead of crossed, for example to the split-plot data acquisition paradigm, and for better data entry error control. 2.3 The Excel data format The Excel file has three worksheets. These are named Truth, NL (or FP), LL (or TP). 2.4 Illustrative toy file Toy files are artificial small datasets intended to illustrate essential features of the data format. The examples shown in this vignette corresponds to Excel file inst/extdata/toyFiles/ROC/rocCr.xlsx in the project directory. To view these files one needs to clone the source files from GitHub. 2.5 The Truth worksheet The Truth worksheet contains 6 columns: CaseID, LesionID, Weight, ReaderID, ModalityID and Paradigm. For ROC data the first five columns contain as many rows as there are cases (images) in the dataset. CaseID: unique integers, one per case, representing the cases in the dataset. LesionID: integers 0 or 1, with each 0 representing a non-diseased case and each 1 representing a diseased case. In the current toy dataset, the non-diseased cases are labeled 1, 2 and 3, while the diseased cases are labeled 70, 71, 72, 73 and 74. The values do not have to be consecutive integers; they need not be ordered; the only requirement is that they be unique. Weight: Not used for ROC data, a floating point value, typically filled in with 0 or 1. ReaderID: a comma-separated listing of reader labels, each represented by a unique string, that have interpreted the case. In the example shown below each cell has the value 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 meaning that each of the readers, represented by the strings “0”, “1”, “2”, “3” and “4”, have interpreted all cases (hence the “crossed” design). With reader names that could be confused with integers, each cell in this column has to be text formatted as otherwise Excel will not accept it. [Try entering 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in a numeric formatted Excel cell.] The reader names could just as well have been Rdr0, Rdr1, Rdr2, Rdr3, Rdr4. The only requirement is that they be unique strings. Look in in the inst/extdata/toyFiles/ROC directory for files rocCrStrRdrsTrts.xlsx and rocCrStrRdrsNonUnique.xlsx for examples of data files using longer strings for readers. The second file generates an error because the reader names are not unique. ModalityID: a comma-separated listing of modalities (one or more modalities), each represented by a unique string, that are applied to each case. In the example each cell has the value \"0\", \"1\". With treatment names that could be confused with integers, each cell has to be text formatted as otherwise Excel will not accept it. The treatment names could just as well have been Trt0, Trt1. Again, the only requirement is that they be unique strings. Paradigm: this column contains two cells, ROC and crossed. It informs the software that this is an ROC dataset, and the design is crossed, meaning each reader has interpreted each case in each modality (in statistical terminology: modality and reader factors are “crossed”). There are 5 diseased cases in the dataset (the number of 1’s in the LesionID column of the Truth worksheet). There are 3 non-diseased cases in the dataset (the number of 0’s in the LesionID column). There are 5 readers in the dataset (each cell in the ReaderID column contains the string 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). There are 2 modalities in the dataset (each cell in the ModalityID column contains the string 0, 1). FIGURE 2.1: Truth worksheet for file rocCr.xlsx 2.6 The structure of an ROC dataset In the following code chunk the first statement retrieves the name of the data file, located in a hidden directory that one need not be concerned with. The second statement reads the file using the function DfReadDataFile() and saves it to object x. The third statement shows the structure of the dataset object x. rocCr &lt;- system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, &quot;toyFiles/ROC/rocCr.xlsx&quot;, package = &quot;RJafroc&quot;, mustWork = TRUE) x &lt;- DfReadDataFile(rocCr, newExcelFileFormat = TRUE) str(x) #&gt; List of 12 #&gt; $ NL : num [1:2, 1:5, 1:8, 1] 1 3 2 3 2 2 1 2 3 2 ... #&gt; $ LL : num [1:2, 1:5, 1:5, 1] 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ... #&gt; $ lesionVector : int [1:5] 1 1 1 1 1 #&gt; $ lesionID : num [1:5, 1] 1 1 1 1 1 #&gt; $ lesionWeight : num [1:5, 1] 1 1 1 1 1 #&gt; $ dataType : chr &quot;ROC&quot; #&gt; $ modalityID : Named chr [1:2] &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; #&gt; ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; #&gt; $ readerID : Named chr [1:5] &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; ... #&gt; ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:5] &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; ... #&gt; $ design : chr &quot;CROSSED&quot; #&gt; $ normalCases : int [1:3] 1 2 3 #&gt; $ abnormalCases: int [1:5] 70 71 72 73 74 #&gt; $ truthTableStr: num [1:2, 1:5, 1:8, 1:2] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... In the above code chunk flag newExcelFileFormat is set to TRUE as otherwise columns D - F in the Truth worksheet are ignored and the dataset is assumed to be crossed, with dataType automatically determined from the contents of the FP and TP worksheets. Flag newExcelFileFormat = FALSE is for compatibility with older JAFROC format Excel files, which did not have these columns in the Truth worksheet. Its usage is deprecated. The dataset object x is a list variable with 12 members. The x$NL member, with dimension [2, 5, 8, 1], contains the ratings of normal cases. The extra values in the third dimension, filled with NAs, are needed for compatibility with FROC datasets, as unlike ROC, false positives are possible on diseased cases. The x$LL, with dimension [2, 5, 5, 1], contains the ratings of abnormal cases. The x$lesionVector member is a vector with 5 ones representing the 5 diseased cases in the dataset. The x$lesionID member is an array with 5 ones. The x$lesionWeight member is an array with 5 ones. The lesionVector, lesionID and lesionWeight members are not used for ROC datasets. They are there for compatibility with FROC datasets. The dataType member indicates that this is an ROC dataset. The x$modalityID member is a vector with two elements \"0\" and \"1\", naming the two modalities. The x$readerID member is a vector with five elements \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\" and \"4\", naming the five readers. The x$design member is CROSSED; specifies the dataset design, which is “CROSSED”. The x$normalCases member lists the integer names of the normal cases, 1, 2, 3. The x$abnormalCases member lists the integer names of the abnormal cases, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74. The x$truthTableStr member quantifies the structure of the dataset, as explained in Chapter 00 Vignette #3-#5. 2.7 The false positive (FP) ratings These are found in the FP or NL worksheet, see below. FIGURE 2.2: FP worksheet for file rocCr.xlsx It consists of 4 columns, each of length 30 (= # of modalities times number of readers times number of non-diseased cases). ReaderID: the reader labels: 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Each reader label occurs 6 times (= # of modalities times number of non-diseased cases). ModalityID: the modality or treatment labels: 0 and 1. Each label occurs 15 times (= # of readers times number of non-diseased cases). CaseID: the case labels for non-diseased cases: 1, 2 and 3. Each label occurs 10 times (= # of modalities times # of readers). The label of a diseased case cannot occur in the FP worksheet. If it does the software generates an error. FP_Rating: the floating point ratings of non-diseased cases. Each row of this worksheet contains a rating corresponding to the values of ReaderID, ModalityID and CaseID for that row. 2.8 The true positive (TP) ratings These are found in the TP or LL worksheet, see below. FIGURE 2.3: TP worksheet for file rocCr.xlsx It consists of 5 columns, each of length 50 (= # of modalities times number of readers times number of diseased cases). ReaderID: the reader labels: 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Each reader label occurs 10 times (= # of modalities times number of diseased cases). ModalityID: the modality or treatment labels: 0 and 1. Each label occurs 25 times (= # of readers times number of diseased cases). LesionID: For an ROC dataset this column contains fifty 1’s (each diseased case has one lesion). CaseID: the case labels for non-diseased cases: 70, 71, 72, 73 and 74. Each label occurs 10 times (= # of modalities times # of readers). The label of a non-diseased case cannot occur in the TP worksheet. TP_Rating: the floating point ratings of diseased cases. Each row of this worksheet contains a rating corresponding to the values of ReaderID, ModalityID, LesionID and CaseID for that row. 2.9 Correspondence between NL member of dataset and the FP worksheet The list member x$NL is an array with dim = c(2,5,8,1). The first dimension (2) comes from the number of modalities. The second dimension (5) comes from the number of readers. The third dimension (8) comes from the total number of cases. The fourth dimension is alway 1 for an ROC dataset. The value of x$NL[1,5,2,1], i.e., 5, corresponds to row 15 of the FP table, i.e., to ModalityID = 0, ReaderID = 4 and CaseID = 2. The value of x$NL[2,3,2,1], i.e., 4, corresponds to row 24 of the FP table, i.e., to ModalityID 1, ReaderID 2 and CaseID 2. All values for case index &gt; 3 are -Inf. For example the value of x$NL[2,3,4,1] is -Inf. This is because there are only 3 non-diseased cases. The extra length is needed for compatibility with FROC datasets. 2.10 Correspondence between LL member of dataset and the TP worksheet The list member x$LL is an array with dim = c(2,5,5,1). The first dimension (2) comes from the number of modalities. The second dimension (5) comes from the number of readers. The third dimension (5) comes from the number of diseased cases. The fourth dimension is alway 1 for an ROC dataset. The value of x$LL[1,1,5,1], i.e., 4, corresponds to row 6 of the TP table, i.e., to ModalityID = 0, ReaderID = 0 and CaseID = 74. The value of x$LL[1,2,2,1], i.e., 3, corresponds to row 8 of the TP table, i.e., to ModalityID = 0, ReaderID = 1 and CaseID = 71. There are no -Inf values in x$LL: any(x$LL == -Inf) = FALSE. 2.11 Correspondence using the which function Converting from names to subscripts (indicating position in an array) can be confusing. The following example uses the which function to help out. The first line says that the abnormalCase named 70 corresponds to subscript 1 in the LL array case dimension. The second line prints the NL rating for modalityID = 0, readerID = 1 and normalCases = 1. The third line prints the LL rating for modalityID = 0, readerID = 1 and abnormalCases = 70. The last line shows what happens if one enters an invalid value for name; the result is a numeric(0). Note that in each of these examples, the last dimension is 1 because we are dealing with an ROC dataset. The reader is encouraged to examine the correspondence between the NL and LL ratings and the Excel file using this method. which(x$abnormalCases == 70) #&gt; [1] 1 x$NL[which(x$modalityID == &quot;0&quot;),which(x$readerID == &quot;1&quot;),which(x$normalCases == 1),1] #&gt; [1] 2 x$LL[which(x$modalityID == &quot;0&quot;),which(x$readerID == &quot;1&quot;),which(x$abnormalCases == 70),1] #&gt; [1] 5 x$LL[which(x$modalityID == &quot;a&quot;),which(x$readerID == &quot;1&quot;),which(x$abnormalCases == 70),1] #&gt; numeric(0) 2.12 References References "],

As a historical note, Eqn. 31 and Eqn. 36 (they differ only in parameterizations) in the referenced publication are provided without proof – it was probably obvious to Prof Metz or he wanted to leave it to us “mere mortals” to figure it out, as a final parting gesture of his legacy. The author once put a significant effort into proving it and even had a bright graduate student from the biostatistics department work on it to no avail. The author has observed that these equations always yield very close to the numerical estimates, to within numerical precisions, so the theorem is correct empirically, but he has been unable to prove it analytically. It is left as an exercise for a gifted reader to prove/disprove these equations. "],
["ROIDataStr.html", "Chapter 4 ROI paradigm data 4.1 Introduction; this vignette is under construction! 4.2 An example ROI dataset 4.3 The ROI Excel data file 4.4 Next, TBA 4.5 References", " Chapter 4 ROI paradigm data 4.1 Introduction; this vignette is under construction! In the region-of-interest (ROI) paradigm (Obuchowski 1997, @RN55) each case is regarded as consisting of \\({Q_{k}}\\) (\\({Q_{k}}\\ge 1\\)) “quadrants” or “regions-of-interest” or ROIs, where k is the case index (\\(k=1,2,...,K\\)) and \\(K\\) is the total number of cases (i.e., case-level non-diseased plus case-level diseased cases). Each ROI needs to be classified, by the investigator, as either ROI-level-non-diseased (i.e., it has no lesions) or ROI-level-diseased (i.e., it has at least one lesion). Note the distinction between case-level and ROI-level truth states. One can have ROI-level non-diseased regions in a case-level diseased case. A case-level diseased case must contain at least one ROI-level diseased region and a case-level non-diseased case cannot have any ROI-level diseased regions. The observer gives a single rating (in fact an ordered label) to each ROI, denoted \\({R_{kr}}\\) (\\(r\\) = 1, 2, …, \\({Q_k}\\)). Here \\(r\\) is the ROI index and \\(k\\) is the case index. The rating can be an integer or quasi- continuous (e.g., 0 – 100), or a floating point value, as long as higher numbers represent greater confidence in presence of one or more lesions in the ROI. The ROI paradigm is not restricted to 4 or even a constant number of ROIs per case. That is the reason for the k subscript in \\({Q_k}\\). The ROI data structure is a special case of the FROC data structure, the essential difference being that the number of ratings per case is an a-priori known value, equal to \\({Q_{k}}\\). ROI-level non-diseased region ratings are stored in the NL field and ROI-level diseased region ratings are stored in the LL field. One can think of the ROI paradigm as similar to the FROC paradigm, but with localization accuracy restricted to belonging to a region (one cannot distinguish multiple lesions within a region). Unlike the FROC paradigm, a rating is required for every ROI. 4.2 An example ROI dataset An example simulated ROI dataset is included as datasetROI. str(datasetROI) #&gt; List of 8 #&gt; $ NL : num [1:2, 1:5, 1:90, 1:4] 0.95 0.927 0.556 0.805 1.421 ... #&gt; $ LL : num [1:2, 1:5, 1:40, 1:4] 1.57 2.31 2.3 2.34 2.34 ... #&gt; $ lesionVector: int [1:40] 2 3 2 2 3 3 1 2 3 3 ... #&gt; $ lesionID : num [1:40, 1:4] 2 1 1 1 1 2 4 1 1 1 ... #&gt; $ lesionWeight: num [1:40, 1:4] 0.5 0.333 0.5 0.5 0.333 ... #&gt; $ dataType : chr &quot;ROI&quot; #&gt; $ modalityID : Named chr [1:2] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; #&gt; ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:2] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; #&gt; $ readerID : Named chr [1:5] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; ... #&gt; ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:5] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; ... datasetROI$NL[1,1,1,] #&gt; [1] 0.9498680 -0.0582497 -0.7763780 0.0120730 mean(datasetROI$NL[,,1:50,]) #&gt; [1] 0.1014348 datasetROI$NL[1,1,51,] #&gt; [1] 1.01867 0.34710 -Inf -Inf datasetROI$lesionVector[1] #&gt; [1] 2 datasetROI$LL[1,1,1,] #&gt; [1] 1.56928 2.05945 -Inf -Inf x &lt;- datasetROI$LL;mean(x[is.finite(x)]) #&gt; [1] 1.815513 Examination of the output reveals that: This is a 2-treatment 5-reader dataset, with 50 non-diseased cases and 40 diseased cases, and \\({Q_k}=4\\) for all k. For treatment 1, reader 1, case 1 (the 1st non-diseased case) the 4 ratings are 0.949868, -0.0582497, -0.776378, 0.012073. The mean of all ratings on non-diseased cases is 0.1014348. For treatment 1, reader 1, case 51 (the 1st diseased case) the NL ratings are 1.01867, 0.3471. There are only two finite values because this case has two ROI-level-diseased regions, and 2 plus 2 makes for the assumed 4-regions per case. The corresponding $lesionVector field is 2. The ratings of the 2 ROI-level-diseased ROIs on this case are 1.56928, 2.05945. The mean rating over all ROI-level-diseased ROIs is 1.8155127. 4.3 The ROI Excel data file An Excel file in JAFROC format containing simulated ROI data corresponding to datasetROI, is included with the distribution. The first command (below) finds the location of the file and the second command reads it and saves it to a dataset object ds. !!!DPC!!! The DfReadDataFile function automatically recognizes that this is an ROI dataset. Its structure is similar to the JAFROC format Excel file, with some important differences, noted below. It contains three worksheets: ## fileName &lt;- system.file( ## &quot;extdata&quot;, &quot;RoiData.xlsx&quot;, package = &quot;RJafroc&quot;, mustWork = TRUE) ## ds &lt;- DfReadDataFile(fileName) ## ds$dataType FIGURE 4.1: Fig. 1 two views of Truth worksheet The Truth worksheet, Fig. 1, indicates which cases are diseased and which are non-diseased and the number of ROI-level-diseased region on each case. There are 50 non-diseased cases (labeled 1-50) under column CaseID and 40 diseased cases (labeled 51-90). The LesionID field for each non-diseased case (e.g., CaseID = 1) is zero and there is one row per case. For diseased cases, this field has a variable number of entries, ranging from 1 to 4. As an example, there are two rows for CaseID = 51 in the Excel file: one with LesionID = 2 and one with LesionID = 3. The Weights field is always zero (this field is not used in ROI analysis). FIGURE 4.2: Fig. 2 two views of FP worksheet The FP (or NL) worksheet - this lists the ratings of ROI-level-non-diseased regions. For ReaderID = 1, ModalityID = 1 and CaseID = 1 there are 4 rows, corresponding to the 4 ROI-level-non-diseased regions in this case. The corresponding ratings are 0.949868, -0.0582497, -0.776378, 0.012073. The pattern repeats for other treatments and readers, but the rating are, of course, different. Each CaseID is represented in the FP worksheet (a rare exception could occur if a case-level diseased case has 4 diseased regions). FIGURE 4.3: Fig. 2 TP worksheet The TP (or LL) worksheet - this lists the ratings of ROI-level-diseased regions. Because non-diseased cases generate TPs, one does not find any entry with CaseID = 1-50 in the TP worksheet. The lowest CaseID in the TP worksheet is 51, which corresponds to the first diseased case. There are two entries for this case, corresponding to the two ROI-level-diseased regions present in this case. Recall that corresponding to this CaseID in the Truth worksheet there were two entries with LesionID = 2 and 3. These must match the LesionID’s listed for this case in the TP worksheet. Complementing these two entries, in the FP worksheet for CaseID = 51, there are 2 entries corresponding to the two ROI-level-non-diseased regions in this case. One should confirm that for each diseased case the sum of the number of entries in the TP and FP worksheets is always 4. 4.4 Next, TBA The next vignette illustrates significance testing for this paradigm. 4.5 References Chakraborty, Dev P. 2017.
