B.2 Abbreviations Correct-localization correct-classification = CL-CC Correct-localization incorrect-classification = CL-IC Incorrect-localization classification not applicable = IL-NA B.3 History and basic idea This project started with a request to extend localization analysis software RJafroc to localization-classification tasks. Since this is new research the required data format is not in the RJafroc documentation. Some familiarity with basic localization task analysis is assumed. The basic idea is that spatial localization is a special case of localization-with-classification. B.4 First example, File1.xlsx This example is implemented in file File1.xlsx. There are four classes of lesions: C1, C2, C3and C4. The rating scale is 1 - 10 and positive-directed. The dataset has 3 cases: 9, 17 and 19. B.4.1 Truth sheet This has the ground truth of for cases and lesions, and specifies their class types. FIGURE B.1: Truth worksheet for File1.xlsx Case 9 has two lesions, with classes C1 and C4. Case 17 has four lesions, with classes C1, C2, C3and C4. Case 19 has one lesion, with class C2. B.4.2 TP sheet This holds CL-CC marks. FIGURE B.2: TP worksheet for File1.xlsx B.4.2.1 Case 9 Lesion C1, lesionID = 1, CL-CC mark rated 5. B.4.2.2 Case 17 Lesion C1, lesionID = 1, CL-CC mark rated 6.1. Lesion C2, lesionID = 2, CL-CC mark rated 7.1. Lesion C4, lesionID = 4, CL-CC mark rated 2.3. B.4.2.3 Case 19 Lesion C2, lesionID = 1, CL-CC mark rated 5.7. B.4.3 FP sheet This holds IL-NA and CL-IC marks. FIGURE B.3: FP worksheet for File1.xlsx B.4.3.1 Case 9 CL-IC mark rated 5.5, C2 classified as C3. This misclassification is especially bad as C3 does not exist on this case. IL-NA mark rated 1.2. B.4.3.2 Case 17 CL-IC mark rated 7, C3 classified as C2. IL-NA mark rated 2.3. IL-NA mark rated 2.1. B.4.3.3 Case 19 IL-NA mark rated 1.4. CL-IC mark rated 6.1, C2 classified as C3.

This example is implemented in file File2.xlsx. FIGURE B.4: TP worksheet for File2.xlsx fileName &lt;- &quot;R/CH83-ClassificationTask/File2.xlsx&quot; x &lt;- DfReadDataFile(fileName = fileName) print(UtilFigureOfMerit(x, FOM = &quot;wAFROC1&quot;)) #&gt; rdr1 #&gt; trt1 0.4583333 B.6 Third example, File3.xlsx Starting with original file, I transferred a CL-IC for case 17 to the TP sheet, where it is a CL_CC mark. This should increase the FOM as credit is given for CL-CC. This example is implemented in file File3.xlsx. FIGURE B.5: TP and FP worksheets for File3.xlsx fileName &lt;- &quot;R/CH83-ClassificationTask/File3.xlsx&quot; x &lt;- DfReadDataFile(fileName = fileName) print(UtilFigureOfMerit(x, FOM = &quot;wAFROC1&quot;)) #&gt; rdr1 #&gt; trt1 0.5277778 B.7 Fourth example, File4.xlsx So far we have dealt with one modality and one reader. Additional algorithmic readers can be added under readerID. They should not be added as additional treatments (has to do with treatment being regarded as a fixed factor and reader as as random factor in the analysis). The starting point is File3.xlsx. I duplicated the data from this for two additional readers to create a single-modality three-reader dataset File4.xlsx. Shown next are the three worksheets. FIGURE B.6: Truth worksheet for File4.xlsx FIGURE B.7: TP worksheet for File4.xlsx Note that the three FOMS are identical. fileName &lt;- &quot;R/CH83-ClassificationTask/File4.xlsx&quot; x &lt;- DfReadDataFile(fileName = fileName) print(UtilFigureOfMerit(x, FOM = &quot;wAFROC1&quot;)) #&gt; rdr1 rdr2 rdr3 #&gt; trt1 0.5277778 0.5277778 0.5277778 FIGURE B.8: FP worksheet for File4.xlsx B.8 Fifth example, File5.xlsx Need to add some randomness to the ratings. I randomly added to the ratings from a uniform distribution in the range -0.5 to +0.5. This is very crude, as in practice the the number of marks will also vary from reader to reader. But file File5.xlsx should give one the general idea of how to extend to several algorithmic readers. Note that now the FOMs are not identical. fileName &lt;- &quot;R/CH83-ClassificationTask/File5.xlsx&quot; x &lt;- DfReadDataFile(fileName = fileName) print(UtilFigureOfMerit(x, FOM = &quot;wAFROC1&quot;)) #&gt; rdr1 rdr2 rdr3 #&gt; trt1 0.3611111 0.5555556 0.4444444 B.9 Precautions Unlike regular RJafroc analysis, there is no error checking of the classification codes C1, etc. For example, if a lesion with class C1 is recorded in the TP sheet as a CL-CC and it is also mistakenly recorded in the FP sheet as a CL-IC, the program does not know about the mistake. Multiple FP on the same case are allowed in FROC analysis. I suggest that the extra columns in the sample files be recorded for your dataset. This will enable me to subsequently include error-checking code for data entry mistakes. For example, the columns Designation, ClassTrue and ClassRx in the FP sheet are currently not read by the software. To make further progress you need to drastically reduce the file size (once the new method is fully developed you can always add the remaining cases and readers). The current file size makes it impossible to fully develop the system. Most studies in this field are done with 2-3 modalities and about 100-200 cases. B.10 Discussion B.11 References "]]
