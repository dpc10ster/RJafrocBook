BitBucket allows code sharing within a closed group of a few users (e.g., myself and a student). Since the purpose of open-source code is to encourage collaborations, this was, in hindsight, an unfortunate choice. Moreover, as my experience with R-packages grew, it became apparent to me that the vast majority of R-packages are shared on GitHub, not BitBucket. For these reasons I have switched to GitHub. Any previous instructions pertaining to BitBucket are obsolete. In order to access GitHub material one needs to create a (free) account. Go to this link and click on Sign Up. REFERENCES "],
