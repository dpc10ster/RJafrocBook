TBA FIGURE 23.1: Variation of AUC vs. \\(\\zeta_1\\) for \\(\\lambda = 10\\); AUC is the wAFROC AUC. panels are labeled by the value of \\(\\mu\\) and zetaMax (i.e., \\(\\zeta_{\\text{max}}\\), the value of \\(\\zeta_1\\) that maximizes AUC). Fig. 23.1 corresponding to \\(\\lambda = 10\\) has four panels showing the variation of wAFROC AUC with \\(\\zeta_1\\). Each panel is labeled by the values of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\zeta_{\\text{max}}\\). For example, the panel labeled mu = 1.5, zetaMax = 1.9 shows that AUC has a maximum at \\(\\zeta_1 = 1.9\\). For \\(\\mu = 1\\) the maximum is at the top of a broad plateau, but for higher values the maximum is better defined. 23.2.2 \\(\\zeta_1\\) optimization for \\(\\lambda = 1\\) Shown next is the variation of wAFROC AUC vs. \\(\\zeta_1\\) for \\(\\lambda = 1\\) and the four values of the \\(\\mu\\) parameter. FIGURE 23.2: Variation of AUC vs. \\(\\zeta_1\\) for \\(\\lambda = 1\\). Fig. 23.2 corresponds to \\(\\lambda = 1\\) and employs a similar labeling scheme as Fig. 23.1. For example, the panel labeled mu = 1, zetaMax = 0.3 shows that AUC has a maximum at \\(\\zeta_1 = 0.3\\). 23.2.3 Summary of simulations and comments TABLE 23.1: Summary of optimal threshold values: “measure” refers to a performance measure, “mu1” refers to \\(\\mu = 1\\), etc. The row labels are as follows: AUC10 is the wAFROC AUC for lambda = 10, AUC01 is the wAFROC AUC for \\(\\lambda = 1\\), NLF10 is NLF for \\(\\lambda = 10\\), …, LLF01 is LLF for \\(\\lambda = 1\\). measure mu1 mu1.5 mu2 mu2.5 AUC10 0.60040 0.72509 0.84127 0.91997 AUC01 0.76760 0.87837 0.93851 0.96879 NLF10 9.98650 6.65767 4.99325 3.99460 LLF10 0.63210 0.77687 0.86466 0.91791 NLF01 0.84134 0.56090 0.42067 0.33654 LLF01 0.61774 0.77205 0.86350 0.91770 TBA 23.2.3.1 Explanations FIGURE 23.3: Extended FROC plots: panel labeled 10-1 is for \\(\\lambda = 10\\) and \\(\\mu = 1\\), and that labeled 10-1.5 is for \\(\\lambda = 10\\) and \\(\\mu = 1.5\\).
