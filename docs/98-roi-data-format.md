# ROI data format {#roidataformat}

## ROI paradigm    
* One can think of the ROI paradigm as similar to the FROC paradigm, but with localization accuracy restricted to belonging to a region (one cannot distinguish multiple lesions within a region). The ROIs are defined prior to the study and made known to all observers participating in the study. Unlike the FROC paradigm, a __rating is required for every ROI__.
